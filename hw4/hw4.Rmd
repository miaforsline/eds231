Read in the Tweet data 
```{r tweet_data}
raw_tweets <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaRo406/EDS_231-text-sentiment/main/dat/IPCC_tweets_April1-10_sample.csv", header=TRUE)

dat <- raw_tweets[,c(4,6)] 

tweets <- tibble(text = dat$Title,
                  id = seq(1:length(dat$Title)),
                 date = as.Date(dat$Date,'%m/%d/%y'))
```

# 1. Think about how to further clean a twitter data set. Let’s assume that the mentions of twitter accounts is not useful to us. Remove them from the text field of the tweets tibble.

Clean up the Tweet data by removing mentions of Twitter accounts 
```{r cleaning_tweets}
#let's clean up the URLs from the tweets
tweets$text <- gsub("http[^[:space:]]*", "",tweets$text) #pull out https and replace them with nothing

tweets$text <- gsub("@*", "",tweets$text) #pull out @ symbol to remove mentions 

tweets$text <- str_to_lower(tweets$text) #convert text to lowercase
```

Load Bing and NRC sentiment lexicons 
```{r cleaning_tweets}
bing_sent <- get_sentiments('bing')
nrc_sent <- get_sentiments('nrc')
```

Tokenize the Tweets into individual words 
```{r cleaning_tweets}
#break it down to one word per row to pull out stop words and identify sentiment words 
words <- tweets %>%
  select(id, date, text) %>%
  unnest_tokens(output = word, input = text, token = "words") %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = "word") %>%
  left_join(bing_sent, by = "word") %>%
  left_join(
    tribble(
      ~sentiment, ~sent_score,
      "positive", 1,
      "negative", -1),
    by = "sentiment")
```

# 2. Compare the ten most common terms in the tweets per day. Do you notice anything interesting?

- identify the top 10 most common words in all tweets for the entire time period
- graph 

```{r}
#identify the top 10 most common words 
common_words <- words %>% 
  count(word) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  slice_head(n = 10)

#create a string of the top 10 most common words 
common_words_string <- common_words$word

#subset the dataframe to include only the 10 most common words 
common_words_over_time <- words %>% 
  subset(word %in% c(common_words_string))

#count how many times each common word is used 
common_words_count <- common_words_over_time %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  count(word)
```

Plot the common word frequency 
```{r}
ggplot(data = common_words_count, aes(x = date, y = n, color = word)) +
  geom_line() + 
  theme_classic() + 
  labs(x = "Date",
       y = "Word Frequency", 
       color = "Common Words") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(as.Date("2022-04-04")), linetype=4) + 
  geom_text(aes(x = as.Date("2022-04-04"),
                label = "IPCC Report Published", 
                y=700), 
            colour="black", 
            angle=0, 
            hjust = -0.05, 
            text=element_text(size=10))
```

After graphing the daily frequency of the top ten most common terms in all the tweets, I noticed that the frequency of all ten words sharply increased on April 4, 2022, which is when the IPCC report was published. This makes sense because the day the report was published was when most people were Tweeting about it. Then the frequencies drop off after April 4 as people become less interested in discussing it on Twitter. 

# 3. Adjust the wordcloud in the “wordcloud” chunk by coloring the positive and negative words so they are identifiable.

Comparison word cloud 
```{r wordcloud_comp}
words %>%
inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
count(word, sentiment, sort = TRUE) %>%
acast(word ~ sentiment, value.var = "n", fill = 0) %>%
comparison.cloud(colors = c("red", "blue"),
                   max.words = 100)
```

# 4. Let’s say we are interested in the most prominent entities in the Twitter discussion. Which are the top 10 most tagged accounts in the data set. Hint: the “explore_hashtags” chunk is a good starting point.

- use quanteda to tokenize and clean Tweet words 

```{r create_corpus}
corpus <- corpus(dat$Title) #enter quanteda

tokens <- tokens(corpus) #tokenize the text so each doc (page, in this case) is a list of tokens (words)

#clean it up
tokens <- tokens(tokens, remove_punct = TRUE, #remove punctuation
                      remove_numbers = TRUE) #remove numbers 

#remove wtop words using the lexicon built into quanteda 
tokens <- tokens_select(tokens, stopwords('english'), selection='remove') 

#change all words to lower case 
tokens <- tokens_tolower(tokens)
```

Mentions in tweets 
```{r explore_hashtags}
#tokenize but keep only a particular pattern (in this case, the @ symbol)
mention_tweets <- tokens(corpus, remove_punct = TRUE) %>% 
                  tokens_keep(pattern = "@*") #@ followed by any other string 

dfm_mention <- dfm(mention_tweets) #shows location of each tweet in the corpus (document feature matrix object)

#identify the most frequently mentioned Twitter accounts 
tstat_freq <- textstat_frequency(dfm_mention, n = 10) 

#display the most frequently mentioned Twitter accounts in a table 
tstat_freq %>% as.data.frame() %>% 
  select(-rank, -group, -docfreq) %>% 
  rename("Twitter Account" = feature,
         Frequency = frequency) %>% 
  kableExtra::kbl() %>% 
  kable_styling()
```


# 5. The Twitter data download comes with a variable called “Sentiment” that must be calculated by Brandwatch. Use your own method to assign each tweet a polarity score (Positive, Negative, Neutral) and compare your classification to Brandwatch’s (hint: you’ll need to revisit the “raw_tweets” data frame).

```{r}
raw_tweets <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaRo406/EDS_231-text-sentiment/main/dat/IPCC_tweets_April1-10_sample.csv", header=TRUE)

dat <- raw_tweets[,c(4,6, 10)] 

tweets <- tibble(text = dat$Title,
                 id = seq(1:length(dat$Title)),
                 date = as.Date(dat$Date,'%m/%d/%y'),
                 sentiment = dat$Sentiment)

tweets <- tweets %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  mutate(sentiment = as.factor(sentiment)) %>% 
  mutate(
    polarity = ifelse(sentiment == "positive", 1, 
                      ifelse(sentiment == "neutral", 0, -1)
                      )
        )

#count how many pos/neutral/neg tweets were calculated by Bandwatch 
bandwatch_polarity_freq <- tweets %>% 
  count(polarity) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

```


```{r}
#list of characters
mytext <- get_sentences(tweets$text)

#sentiments from the text 
sent <- sentiment(mytext) %>% 
  group_by(element_id) %>% 
  summarise(avg_sentiment = mean(sentiment))

#create dataframe of sentiments of each sentence 
sentiment_df <- inner_join(raw_tweets, sent, by = "element_id")

sentiment <- sentiment_by(sentiment_df$headline)
```
