(Credit: Rick Scibelli Jr. for The New York Times)) Until recently, natural landscapes varied as droughts came and went, warm years were followed by cold years and so on. Now, though, the actions of people have widened the parameters of this natural change, with potentially troubling results in places like the Southwest.  That's what William deBuys, an author and conservationist who has spent decades working in and writing about the region, says in the current issue of Rangelands, a publication of the Society for Range Management. (You can download a pdf of his essay here.)  In particular he is talking about the mountains and rangelands of New Mexico. Always shaped by fire, lately they have been shaped by fire suppression. Always modified by grazing elk and other animals, now they are threatened by overgrazing of livestock. Always vulnerable to drought, now they are stricken by drought and heat together. And the heat is not the heat of a normal warm year, it is the heat of human-induced climate change, he says.  ""Say hello to the Anthropocene,"" he writes, using a relatively recent coinage for the geological time we live in. Not the Holocene — the name earth scientists give to the era that began about 11,000 years ago, when the last glaciers of the last Ice Age made their last retreat — but the Anthropocene, the new era when people's actions alter conditions on Earth.  Mr. deBuys compares the landscape today with the conditions of 1903, when a government naturalist named Vernon O. Bailey surveyed the area and its high-altitude forests, or the drought years of the 1950s, when Tony Hillerman, the writer whose novels brought the arid landscape to life, recorded the effects of what was regarded then as a pretty severe dry spell.  Mr. Hillerman, who died last month, was a reporter for The Santa Fe New Mexican then, and what he wrote in 1957 about bark beetles stripping ""a vast area of Northern New Mexico of its pinon and ponderosa pine"" might have been written in the recent drought of 2002-2003. But the landscape changes of the 1950s came more slowly. The recent drought occurred ""significantly faster"" and with significantly greater mortality not just among trees, but shrubs and grasses as well, Mr. deBuys writes.  ""The key variable was temperature,"" he says. Though the 1950s drought were drier, the drought of 2002-2003 was hotter. ""Nightmarish scenarios follow from these data,"" he goes on, ""multiyear drought punctuated by intense heat waves leading to rapid ecosystem diebacks that in turn trigger other nonlinear processes of erosion and fire. Where might such cycles of change lead?""  As new information accumulates, it is becoming harder and harder to answer that question, Mr. deBuys concludes. Like investors reading the warnings in a stock prospectus, he says, land and water managers must now realize that ""past performance is no guarantee of future results.""  It's a new era, he concludes, adding, ""Fasten your seat belts.""

OK,Copyright (c) 2022 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.,"  Without question, the dinkiest plant in my garden these last few seasons has been the American elm tree my father-in-law gave me three years ago. I realize that ""dinky"" is not a word often attached to elm trees -- ""graceful"" or ""venerable"" or even, in recent years, ""dead"" are a lot more like it. But there is no getting around the fact that the leafless, 14-inch chopstick that arrived in the mail from the Elm Research Institute in Harrisville, N.H., was a poor excuse for a tree. Swaddled in a sheet of The Manchester Union Leader, it had not even a single branch -- just a couple of bud-eyes at one end and a straggle of root hairs at the other.   I had formed a somewhat grander picture of my tree when Roy had first called to tell me it was on the way.

Today's sobering story on how economic turmoil could blunt climate-friendly energy plans, by Elisabeth Rosenthal, implies that a new kind of climate and energy trance may indeed be nigh -- not one created just by dropping prices for coal and oil but also by the urgency of a global economic retreat. Below I seek your thoughts on what could avoid a return to trance mode.  There've been two periods that could be construed as climate shocks along the 100-year trajectory of science pointing to human-caused heating of the Earth. The first came in the summer of 1988. Blazing heat and drought in the North, the combustion of Yellowstone and the Amazon, and warnings from scientists led by James E. Hansen led to a burst of headlines and scientific conferences, the creation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the negotiating path toward agreement on the first climate treaty in 1992.   Then came the trance, acknowledged by former President Bill Clinton in a video interview. Low energy prices, the distraction of the first Persian Gulf war, and a temporary cool spell following the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines all helped tamp down global warming as an issue through much of the 1990's, outside the brief burst of triumphant proclamations with the 1997 negotiation of the Kyoto Protocol, a stricter addendum to the faltering 1992 climate pact.  The second shock built slower and has lasted longer. It started with the European heat wave of 2003 and intensified from 2005 to 2007 as Hurricane Katrina and ""An Inconvenient Truth"" put climate in the headlines, the science pointing to a human hand on the planet's thermostat coalesced with the fourth I.P.C.C. report, and the Arctic Ocean sea ice peeled back in a way never observed before.   Many climate scientists have insisted that this is not a shock, but the opening salvo from nature in a new age of climatic destabilization: Global warming, they say, is no longer a ""somewhere, someday"" issue but here and now. Other serious researchers in the field, while convinced of the building long-term danger, warn that nature will almost surely jostle chaotically through cool and warm spells along the way to what Dr. Hansen calls ""a different planet."" They warn not to read too much into current events (particularly hurricanes) unless you're ready to explain the quiet seasons and cold snaps along with the tempests and heat waves.  The question is, can societies commit to a sustained effort to move beyond fossil fuels (and to curtail the destruction of tropical forests) even as nature runs hot and cold -- and especially as the economy does the same?   In today's story, European environmental officials echo what President-elect Barack Obama has said, insisting that the burst of government spending aimed at restoring economic vigor can be directed toward building the foundations of an environmentally sound energy supply. But the story includes ample hints that such a focus may be tough to sustain given how costly the non-polluting energy technologies remain compared to fossil options, at least if energy costs are measured using conventional economic yardsticks that don't include long-term costs.   What can avert the return to trance mode? The other day, the energy specialist and climate campaigner Joe Romm told me that a necessary element for getting America mobilized to lead the world to a new non-polluting energy future was a big wakeup call from nature. ""We will need a WWII-style approach, but that can only happen after we get the global warming Pearl Harbor or, more likely, multiple Pearl Harbors,"" he wrote. (He blogged on the question on Climateprogress.org, as well.)  I asked him what that might look like and he sent the following list. I'll be annotating it shortly. What's your take on whether these events are likely, or would do the trick?    1) Arctic goes ice free before 2020. I have bets out on this. It would be a big, visible global shock. 2) Rapid warming over next decade, as recent Nature and Science article suggests is quite possible (posts here and here) 3) Continued (unexpected) surge in methane 4) A megadrought hitting the SW comparable to what has hit southern Australia. 5) More superstorms, like Katrina 6) A heatwave as bad as Europe's 2003 one. 7) Something unpredicted but clearly linked to climate, like the bark beetle devastation. 8) Accelerated mass loss in Greenland and/or Antarctica, perhaps with another huge ice shelf breaking off, but in any case coupled with another measurable rise in the rate of sea level rise, 9) The Fifth Assessment Report (2012-2013) really spelling out what we face with no punches pulled.

All Rights Reserved.,"WASHINGTON — The opening weeks of the new Democratic-controlled Congress have become the season of climate change.Since the current session began last month, lawmakers have introduced more than 10 bills addressing global warming. Several committees have scheduled hearings, including two yesterday and another today . And former vice president Al Gore, whose Oscar-nominated film ""An Inconvenient Truth"" has drawn millions of moviegoers, is scheduled to testify on Capitol Hill next month.After hearing from scientists and conservationists, Senator John Warner, Republican of Virginia, suggested a road trip to see the changes in the environment first hand.Though scientists have long warned about global warming, the issue had taken a back seat on the national agenda in recent years because of the Bush administration's opposition to mandatory caps on greenhouse gas emissions, which many scientists blame for the problem. But the Democratic takeover of Congress in November -- along with a disturbing report from a meeting of world-renowned scientists last week -- has given the issue new urgency among lawmakers.Although there were just five senators present and five panelists at one of the hearings yesterday, the clashes between lawmakers and specialists on the topic could be seen as a preview of the hearings that lay ahead.One prominent scientist warned of catastrophic changes, while another said he was skeptical. Senator James M. Inhofe , an Oklahoma Republican, reiterated his belief that no one really knows what is causing global warming, but Senator Barbara Boxer , a California Democrat, presented poster-sized pictures of polar bears, saying that human-generated greenhouse gas emissions must be stopped or the bears would be threatened with extinction.Yesterday's hearing was the first-ever session of the Subcommittee on Private Sector and Consumer Solutions to Global Warming and Wildlife Protection . Boxer heralded a report last week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in which hundreds of the world's top scientists declared that humans are almost certainly the reason behind the irrefutable warming of the planet.""If the Earth continues to warm, many animals will be forced to live in conditions that they are not well adapted"" to , Boxer said.Four specialists testified that's already happening.Thomas E. Lovejoy , president of the Washington-based Heinz Center for Science, Economics and the Environment , said that climate change disrupts the timing of animal migration and flowering of plants.""Nature is on the move,"" he said, citing reports that showed tree swallows laying eggs nine days early by 1991 compared with 1959; lilacs in the Western United States flowering two days earlier per decade; and the Edith's Checkerspot butterfly moving its geographical range steadily northward and upslope over the past decades.Lovejoy said destructive pests like the pine bark beetle, which had been held in check by other species, are now thriving, due in part to warmer weather. That, he said, has led to the loss of wide areas of pine forests.Roger Mann , a professor at the College of William and Mary who has studied the Chesapeake Bay ecology for 30 years, said that a 3.5-degree rise in the water's temperature in 2005 killed large underwater fields of eel grass, the prime habitat for small crabs and fish. The crabs and fish have struggled to survive without it, he said. ""Just a very small temperature change led to very significant losses,"" Mann said.But Inhofe doubted that carbon dioxide emissions, and humans, are to blame.""If a particular species is declining, it does not mean that man is at fault or that it is due to global warming,"" he said. ""The fact is that the relationship between species and climate is not clearly understood.""A. Lee Foote, an associate professor at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, said the decline in population of polar bears could be due to an increase in hunters, not global warming.Late last year, the Bush administration proposed listing polar bears as threatened on the list of the Endangered Species Act because of melting ice. If polar bears are put on the list, it would force the administration to try to do something to protect the bears' habitat. Many scientists believe that would mean forcing industries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, something the administration has long opposed.In the middle of the debate sat Warner, 79, who recalled boyhood hunting and fishing trips taken with his father in Virginia. He said he worries that climate change is threatening the lakes, rivers, and woods he knew when he was young, and proposed a fact-finding ""field trip"" so senators could see any changes for themselves.One environmentalist suggested traveling to the shrinking glaciers at Glacier National Park in Montana. Another recommended exploring the ""dead zones"" in Chesapeake Bay .Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut independent who chaired the subcommittee, suggested after the meeting that another trip could be to New England. Lieberman, who stated that Warner's influence ""will be very significant"" when lawmakers begin considering climate change legislation, said he would like to show the senator maple trees in northern New England, where maple syrup makers are tapping trees as much as a month or more earlier than March, the usual beginning of sap runs.Globe reporter Beth Daley contributed to this report.",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/08/world/americas/08iht-web.0208.globewarm.4524313.html,,"WASHINGTON — The opening weeks of the new Democratic-controlled Congress have become the season of climate change.Since the current session began last month, lawmakers have introduced more than 10 bills addressing global warming.

All Rights Reserved.,An energy expert critiques Jim Hansen's energy prescription and describes what an Obama climate policy must contain.,https://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/24/blogs/24dotearth-joe-romm529.html,An energy expert critiques Jim Hansen's energy prescription and describes what an Obama climate policy must contain.,"When global warming enters the realm of politics, the conversation usually focuses on a few ""solutions"" -- a bill capping carbon dioxide, ""clean coal,"" a climate treaty (you've read a lot here on ""clean coal""; a lot more on treaties is coming shortly).   (Photo: Joe Romm of ClimateProgress.org (Alliance to Save Energy)) Joe Romm, an energy specialist, climate campaigner and blogger (and someone who has taken issue with my characterization of the climate challenge), has been trying to lay out the hard reality of what it would really take to cut carbon dioxide emissions as humanity grows and continues trying to prosper. After James E. Hansen of NASA posted his latest prescription for energy policies to limit climate risks, Mr. Romm posted an open letter to Dr. Hansen saying why he feels the NASA climate scientist has the science right, but the energy strategy wrong.   Among other points, Mr. Romm says the ""fourth generation"" form of nuclear power discussed by Dr. Hansen has no greater potential benefits than other technologies (solar-thermal power plants, for example) that were not mentioned but that could be deployed at large scale much more quickly.   He also rejects Dr. Hansen's push for a tax instead of a cap to drive down emissions of greenhouse gases, but at the same time acknowledges that cap-and-trade legislation limiting emissions -- widely portrayed by politicians as the prime point of debate -- is not Step 1, but part of a long-term strategy. Keep that in mind as the Congressional debate begins.   There's a lot more in Mr. Romm's Sunday post and the string of earlier pieces he links to. Here's a follow-up e-chat I had with him last night to amplify on a few points. My four questions are followed by his answers.    1. You seem to say that if folks change the message (better journalism; better, more informed leaders), the public will then buy the higher costs and changes that are now politically untenable. Do you really believe that or am I misreading?   2. As I wrote in 2006 (""Yelling Fire on a Hot Planet"") problems that get people's attention (and cause them to change) are ""soon, salient and certain"" and the dangerous aspects of human-forced climate disruption remain none of those things. The factors that matter most to society are the least certain, like the overall sensitivity of climate to rising CO2, the rate of sea level rise by 2100, even as the long-term picture remains clear (as I've written for ages). As Sir Nicholas Stern put it, ""The sting is in the tail."" Gary Yohe at Yale says uncertainty, not what is known, is the reason to act. Is your own definition of urgency a function of what's known, or what's possible?  3. You call global warming urgent and call Barack Obama's climate plan ""extraordinary."" (By the way, when you predict conservatives will torpedo it, are you including Democrats from fossil states?) But with Mr. Obama's much-repeated $15 billion per year for advanced clean energy contingent on cap-and-trade auction revenues that may not come for years, do you see that as conveying adequate urgency?  4. Can you point me to your best explanation for how a politically feasible cap-and-trade bill -- even one crafted by a relatively climate-friendly Congress -- will have any impact at all on emissions sufficient for the atmosphere to notice by midcentury or so? (This is particularly important given that the financial mess may have reduced taxpayers' confidence in any trading system involving billions of dollars and something as hard to weigh as tons of carbon dioxide.)  From Joe Romm:     On the science If people understood what Hansen has been explaining, what the IPCC report says if you read it closely, what climate scientists say off the record, what I try to cull together from the literature, they would understand that we can't go above 450 p.p.m. [parts per million of CO2 in the atmosphere], because that will almost certainly take us across thresholds that shoot to 750 to 1000 p.p.m. -- and that is 5°C+ warming, and that is an ice-free planet. You and I have talked about this briefly sometimes. In particular, if carbon in the tundra and the peatlands start to go in a serious fashion, especially as methane, then it is game over.  On scientists  a) Few understand energy, so they only understand one half of the grim equation. Only people like Hansen, who have taken the time to educate themselves on energy understand how dire things really are. b) They refuse to internalize the fact that the world isn't listening to them, so they keep running all these models of 450 p.p.m. and 550 p.p.m. and 650 p.p.m. that create this absurdly false range of future impacts. And this leaves policy makers with the notion that scientists don't know with precision what's going to happen.  There isn't any uncertainty about what happens if we keep doing nothing or very little. The people who are peddling the uncertainty myth are internalizing the notion that politicians are going to start deploying multiple wedges starting almost immediately. [""Wedges"" comes from an assessment by two Princeton scientists of ways to get big CO2 emission reductions from particular sectors, like transportation and efficiency (see our 2006 graphic explaining some emission wedges). Mr. Romm's posts provide good background on this thought experiment.]  This may well be my biggest disagreement with you. You understand this but you don't convey this to your readers: Doing nothing or doing little eliminates the uncertainty.    On what drives action and what kind of leaders we need This post [on lessons from the financial bailout] lays out my thinking:  Multi-hundred-billion-dollar-sized government action happens only when there is a very, very big crisis.... A necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a crisis to be ""very, very big"" is that it must be labeled as such by very serious people who are perceived as essentially nonpartisan opinion leaders.... In addition, bad things must be happening to regular people right now.... The credible people must say that the government action is going to solve the problem.  Then I say how this applies to climate.  Better journalism would help. You perhaps saw my article criticizing the NYT on the bark beetle story.  We simply don't have a critical mass of credible nonpartisan opinion leaders who understand the nature of our energy and climate problem.  On Obama What we most need now is an educator and persuader in chief. That we have. Can he start doing a half-dozen wedges? No. But can he create the technological means and public knowledge needed so that the next president can when things start really going bad? Yes.  We will need a WWII-style approach, but that can only happen after we get the global warming Pearl Harbor or, more likely, multiple Pearl Harbors. The crucial thing is that we need to be ready when that happens both technologically and politically. That will take 5 to 10 years -- and not because we need breakthroughs, but because we need to see some significant penetration of things like CSP and plug-ins [CSP is concentrated solar power, or arrays of mirrors that generate heat to drive a generator; ""plug ins"" refers to plug-in hybrid vehicles.] so they can be really ramped up.  For me, 2015 is the target year. If you have any cost-effective, scalable low carbon technology then, that's what we'll go with. Obama will launch the $15 billion a year in 2009. I suspect the first two years will be part of the stimulus -- which I expect will have many more tens of billions of dollars in it for clean energy. Future years can be forward borrowed until the cap kicks in.  On cap and trade legislation I don't see that as the first strategy anymore, as I said in my Nature Online article. The latest science suggests that national and global climate policy is seriously misdirected. We must aim at achieving average annual carbon dioxide emissions of less than 5 GtC [5 billion metric tons of carbon] this century or risk the catastrophe of reaching atmospheric concentrations of 1,000 p.p.m.   A carbon price set by a cap-and-trade system is a useful component of a longer-term climate strategy. Implementing such a system, however, is secondary to adopting a national and global strategy to stop building new traditional coal-fired plants while starting to deploy existing and near-term low-carbon technologies as fast as is humanly possible.  So we need to stop new coal now. Ramp up spending on technology deployment now. Shift state regulations to put energy efficiency on an at least an equal footing as supply. Meanwhile, we enact a hard cap without many offsets.  One final point -- those ""impossible"" eight wedges I laid out probably represent a switch in investment of 2% to 3% of global GDP if done in two decades, half that if done in four decades (as the I.E.A. analysis shows). That is a fantastic quantity of money in absolute terms but a very small fraction of our wealth. Plus you get back a lot of the money in energy savings.  That's why I.E.A. and I.P.C.C. and McKinsey find that 450 p.p.m. only slows GDP maybe 0.1% per year. MONEY isn't the problem. Time and political will are the problem.  There are a few important points above that I'll be writing on -- and asking Mr. Romm about -- in coming weeks, months (and, yes, probably years).   Perhaps the most important one comes where Mr. Romm -- echoing others, including Paul Hawken here -- says that meaningful climate policy, even with leadership and effective communication, still requires another element: ""Bad things must be happening to regular people right now....""   As I wrote in our ""Climate Divide"" package, however, wealthy countries are already using wealth and technology to shield themselves from the hazards that attend climate extremes even as poor countries in the South are most apt to get hammered. What kind of wake-up call does Mr. Romm think is conceivable on a time scale relevant to near-term policy? [UPDATE 12:30 p.m. - His answer is below.]  Lacking that element (and my sense is that nature may well exhibit more than enough variability for years to mask potential ""Pearl Harbor"" moments), does Mr. Romm see his game plan holding up? That's why I've been asking, ""Can Climate Campaigns Withstand a Cooling Test?"" and ""Are Words Worthless in the Climate Fight?""  I'll also keep examining arguments for an ""energy quest"" in which cutting climate risks is one component, and a greatly intensified, sustained research enterprise focused on energy frontiers is also a top priority. Look at the graph in my post on what an ""energy moon shot"" would look like to see the effort and investment that went into the Apollo program and the war on cancer.

Joe Romm's answer to the question above on near-term ""Pearl Harbors"":        Mutliple Pearl Harbors over the next decade -- half or more of these happening:  1) Arctic goes ice free before 2020. I have bets out on this. It would be a big, visible global shock. 2) Rapid warming over next decade, as recent Nature and Science article suggests is quite possible (posts here and here) 3) Continued (unexpected) surge in methane 4) A megadrought hitting the SW comparable to what has hit southern Australia. 5) More superstorms, like Katrina 6) A heatwave as bad as Europe's 2003 one. 7) Something unpredicted but clearly linked to climate, like the bark beetle devastation. 8) Accelerated mass loss in Greenland and/or Antarctica, perhaps with another huge ice shelf breaking off, but in any case coupled with another measurable rise in the rate of sea level rise, 9) The Fifth Assessment Report (2012-2013) really spelling out what we face with no punches pulled.

I've always made pickled gherkins from pickling cucumbers, carefully harvesting the baby ones while they were still very small and firm. Now, I've been told that ''real gherkins'' are actually a different vegetable. Is this true?    A. Real gherkins are really cool cucumbers, not a different vegetable but a different species. Standard slicers and picklers are both Cucumis sativus; gherkins are C. anguria. They're often called West India gherkins, a reference to their route here from Africa. They're also known as bur, or burr, gherkins, a very good description of the small, oval fruits, which are covered with soft spines. They have thin, pale green skin, lots of tiny seeds and an agreeable, distinctive flavor clearly related to that of cucumbers yet not exactly the same.

The Russian Government moved hastily last week to avert financial collapse with a series of drastic measures, including delaying payments for 90 days on foreign debt owed mostly by banks, a restructuring of Government bonds and the sacrifice of the ruble to market forces. The value of the Russian currency is now free to float as low as 9.5 to the dollar, a risky step -- tantamount to devaluation -- that many people fear could prompt a new round of inflation. It could also wipe out as much as a third of the ruble's purchasing power in an economy heavily dependent on imports. The decision came after a request for $22.6 billion from the West was turned down. Standard & Poor's cut Russia's long-term foreign-currency debt rating by two notches. For this beggar at a McDonald's in Moscow, the collapsing ruble was not of immediate concern.

OK,Copyright (c) 2022 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.,"THE grizzly bears of Yellowstone Park are a national treasure, owned by nobody, preserved in trust for everybody, like the gold reserves of Fort Knox, the memory of Louis Armstrong and the clear air over western Nebraska on a breezy spring day. For 31 years, those bears have been listed as ''threatened,'' and therefore protected from hunting and certain other tribulations under the Endangered Species Act. But recently the Interior Department has proposed removing them from the list, and this year, after a period for public comment that ends on Feb. 15, Interior Secretary Gale Norton will make a decision. That decision, though political, will in some degree be informed by science. The scientific question is, How safe are Yellowstone's grizzlies from extinction?

For 31 years, those bears have been listed as ""threatened,"" and therefore protected from hunting and certain other tribulations under the Endangered Species Act. But recently the Interior Department has proposed removing them from the list, and this year, after a period for public comment that ends on Feb. 15, Interior Secretary Gale Norton will make a decision.

The low, omnipresent hum seeps through windows and doors and blends with the rush of air from the vents of our HVAC unit. So, for the life of me, I couldn’t figure out why I was hearing it in the penumbra of an old-growth floodplain forest in South Carolina, a forest that once stretched as far north as Upper Virginia and as far west as East Texas.

All Rights Reserved.,"  HOPPER RECALLED     Arthayer Sanborn will talk about his long friendship with Edward Hopper, Hopper's wife, Jo, and his sister Marion today at Hopper House in Nyack. The art center at 82 North Broadway was converted from the birthplace and boyhood home of the noted American artist 20 years ago this month by the Edward Hopper Landmark Foundation.    Mr. Sanborn is the former rector of the First Baptist Church on North Broadway, which the Hopper family attended. He will take with him some of ""Eddie's"" early drawings as a student at Nyack High School, and various Hopper memorabilia that he has collected over the years.    ""He was a giant of a man, physically,"" Mr. Sanborn said, ""but a very quiet giant. His wife and sister did most of the talking for him."" The simplicity and sensitivity that mark Hopper's work, Mr. Sanborn said, were an integral part of his personality. He died in 1967 at the age of 85.    An exhibition of reproductions, to remain through the summer, will trace the development of Hopper as an artist. ""We can't afford to buy his paintings or even his works on paper,"" said Lawrence Heyl Jr., director of the center. ""A small black and white steel engraving that I saw in Manhattan recently was $50,000.""    According to Mr. Heyl, Hopper was not a very prolific artist, having painted a few hundred oils and watercolors and some graphics that are distributed throughout 30 museums in the United States and numerous private collections. ""They are rarely on the market,"" Mr. Heyl said. For more information, call 358-4381. CARTOON EXHIBITION     The Museum of Cartoon Art's traveling exhibition at the White Plains Library, opening Saturday and running through Sept. 14, is a reminder that the museum will be moving from its Rye Brook quarters to Florida, probably by the end of the year, said Barbara Hammond, the director.    ""Masters of Cartoon Art,"" as the exhibition is called, features original drawings and colored photoengravings dating from 19th-century satirical drawings by Honore Daumier to the contemporary cartoons of Garry Trudeau.    Among the dozens of legendary cartoonists represented in the show are Thomas Nast, the father of political cartooning; Richard Outcault, creator of ""Hogan's Alley"" and ""Buster Brown""; Rudolph Dirks and his ""Katzenjammer Kids,"" Walt Kelly's ""Pogo,"" Rube Goldberg's ""Boob McNutt,"" Bud Fisher's ""Mutt and Jeff,"" Hal Foster's ""Prince Valiant,"" works by Pat Oliphant and Al Hirschfeld, and ""Beetle Bailey"" by Mort Walker, who founded the museum in Greenwich in 1974.    The 9,000-square-foot museum, a former private mansion on Comly Avenue, is up for sale at $1.6 million, ""but we would probably take less,"" Ms. Hammond said. A city-owned site in Boca Raton, Fla., has been selected as a new location, available on a long-term lease. The museum must raise the money to build a 40,000-square-foot site that will house a theater for screening cartoons and holding special events, as well as substantial exhibition space for all the material it now keeps in storage.    Gallery hours in White Plains are Mondays through Thursdays, 9 A.M. to 9 P.M.; and Fridays, 9 A.M. to 6 P.M. The library is downtown at 100 Martine Avenue. TRIBUTE TO DANES     In October 1943 more than 7,000 Danish Jews and some non-Jewish spouses were transported in hundreds of small boats to safety in Sweden, avoiding a scheduled Nazi roundup of the total population of 8,000 Jews for shipment to concentration camps.    In appreciation of the courage shown by the Danes who organized and carried out the exodus in defiance of Nazi authorities, an Act of Courage Award will be presented by the Rockland Center for Holocaust Studies to a member of the Danish Consulate in New York City this week.    The ceremony will take place at 8 P.M. Tuesday in the center headquarters at 17 South Madison Avenue, Spring Valley, N.Y. Dr. Leon Falik, president of Tribute to the Danes and Other Rescuers, an American-Israeli organization based in Manhattan, will be the speaker. The public is welcome to attend. Call 356-2700 for more information. REAL EARTH TONES     Sticks, stones, earth, trees, bark, mud, water, shells, natural light and an occasional bit of paint or other art material are the components of works in the exhibition opening today at the Katonah Museum on Route 22 at Jay Street.    ""Sticks and Stones: 10 Artists Work with Nature"" is an indoor-outdoor exhibition by artists who are accustomed to seeking their materials in the landscape, rather than using manmade materials to reproduce a landscape. They are not part of a school, nor do they necessarily know each other. Patrick Dougherty, Kim Jones, Ilan Averbuch, Mel Kenrick, Robert Lobe, Giuseppe Penone, Alan Sonfist, Michaelle Stuart, James Surls and James Turrell are the 10 artists.    The more malleable materials are shaped into two- and three-dimensional forms that are free-standing, or hang off the exterior walls of the museum or are mounted in the galleries. Rigid materials are arranged into forms or combined with other things to alter their characteristics.    Because the process of installation was as wild as the works themselves, a video was made of it, featuring interviews with the artists. It is to be shown daily on a multi-monitor setup in the lobby.    The show will run through Sept 1. Museum hours are Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays from noon to 5 P.M., Wednesdays from noon to 8 P.M., and Saturdays from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Call 232-9555 for more information. CALL FOR VOLUNTEERS     Volunteers from the age of 13 to adults of any age are needed at the Greenburgh Nature Center to devote one morning or afternoon a week to helping out in one of three areas.    More than 140 animals are housed at the center, from mice to pythons. Many are there temporarily, having been rescued from the wild. Volunteers are needed to assist with their care, in showing them to the public, and helping to improve the wildlife exhibits.    In the 500-square-foot greenhouse completed three years ago, there are tropical, subtropical and desert plants, exhibitions that are mounted and changed seasonally, and displays relating to propogation, all needing attention. Outdoors the rock and herb gardens, a wildflower garden, lawn shrubs and flower beds require more tending than the staff can provide.    Finally, those with administrative, typing or computer skills would be of help in the office, or working on publicity, or staffing the gift shop. Staff professionals supply all the initial instruction and ongoing guidance.   The center, on Dromore Road off Central Avenue, is open daily except Friday from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. The grounds are open from dawn to dusk. Call 723-3470 for more information or to sign on as a volunteer.",https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/09/nyregion/westchester-guide-572491.html,,HOPPER RECALLED,WC,12,The New York Times,,,1991-06-09T05:00:00+0000,article,Westchester Weekly Desk,New York,News,nyt://article/ea632497-2712-5e59-a0ce-77a77e10f2a4,1089,nyt://article/ea632497-2712-5e59-a0ce-77a77e10f2a4,NA,WESTCHESTER GUIDE,NA,NA,WESTCHESTER GUIDE,NA,NA,NA,By Eleanor Charles,,NA,358,260,49

OK,Copyright (c) 2022 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.,"As we contemplated what people a thousand years from now might want to know about us, a question naturally arose: what's missing from our picture of the world a thousand years ago? One answer was obvious: a sense of the experience of everyday life -- the sights, sounds and sensations that time washes away almost instantly. For the Times Capsule, we set out to document the texture of life today, at least in a single place at a single moment. And so, on Sept. 9, 1999, at 9:09 a.m., a moment chosen strictly for its symmetry, more than a hundred writers, photographers, artists, sound recordists, filmmakers and students fanned out across the five boroughs to document a single minute -- the same minute -- in the life of New York. They came back with a mosaic of 60 ordinary seconds that will, we hope, last a millennium.    B - Bronx  M - Manhattan  Q - Queens  B - Brooklyn  S - Staten Island    M - Stills from a Film by Bennett Miller outside Grand Central Terminal  This film and other audiovisual contributions to the New York Minute can be seen and heard in their entireties at www.nytimes.com/nyminute.    339 cars and trucks entered New York City: 12 via the Bayonne Bridge; 18, Goethals Bridge; 147, George Washington Bridge; 38, Holland Tunnel; 85, Lincoln Tunnel; 39, Outerbridge Crossing. Traffic police officers issued 46 parking tickets.    M - Michael Schmelling  Municipal Building, Chambers Street  A kiss is more than just a kiss for Suzanna Remedios and Hormoz Sabet, who have just exchanged wedding vows in a civil service at the marriage bureau.    M - Charles Harbutt  Fifth Avenue and 13th Street  Jamal Rahimi, a vendor from Afghanistan, serves up morning sustenance.    M - Merry Alpern West 12th Street    Q - Aaron Lee Fineman  Rikers Island  Badge No. 15053, aka Kelsey Bragg, keeps an eye on a photographer in Cellblock 1B at the city jail's James A. Thomas Center.    M - Tony Law  Broadway and Houston Street  A woman crossing Houston Street was hit by a car. After being administered to by paramedics, she walked away.    M - Elisabeth Bumiller City Hall  Elisabeth Bumiller, a reporter for The Times, covers Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.  The mayor's daily 8 a.m. staff meeting, in City Hall's Committee of the Whole Room, first used by Mayor DeWitt Clinton in 1812, is running late, the definition of any mayoral meeting of any century. The morning light coming in through the windows of the Federal-style room illuminates aides seated around a gleaming mahogany table, watching Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani listen to his commissioner of the administration for Children's Services, Nicholas Scoppetta.    Scoppetta briefs Giuliani about a rally the mayor will attend for directors of the city's foster-care agencies. When Scoppetta mentions a judge who is expected to be there, the mayor, perhaps aware that his New York minute is not yet riveting, or maybe that he is not yet the central character, makes a move.    ''Do I get my money for jury service?'' he breaks in, referring to his service as a juror days earlier in a personal-injury case.    Scoppetta, absorbed in his presentation, at first takes no notice. ''And he,'' Scoppetta continues, ''he will bring--''    ''A check?'' offers the mayor, to laughter.    ''A check,'' says Scoppetta jovially, catching on, just before the minute is over.    M - Chang-rae Lee Le Monde gourmet Deli, 38 West 48th Street  Chang-rae Lee is the author, most recently, of ''A Gesture Life,'' a novel.  Seung-lae Lee, the proprietor, my cousin, presides over his short-order cooks cracking eggs onto the griddle, two by two. ''Pretty busy this morning,'' he says. And so it is. In this get-to-work rush, the customers line the length of the front counter, each waiting for their breakfast sandwich or bagel to be wrapped in foil and passed over the gleaming glass case. They stand, watching the action, with an uncommon New York patience, for they know it'll be just another minute. Behind the counter, the people-machine is running in high gear, the orders taken and called out, the responses barked back, the talk flying forth in Spanglish and English and Koreanese. Lee's wife is directing it all, shouting, ''Yo, amigo,'' and ''Yes, ma'am,'' and ''Coffee, coffee, ha-rha-buh-gee [grandpa in Korean]?'' her addresses wholly indiscriminate and sweet. Somehow, everyone understands. The two cashier girls ring it up, making change in their heads, their hands moving at the light-speed of a dollar being spent in Manhattan. This is not virtual commerce. Lee knows this, and takes a few overflow orders himself, relaying them to the griddle men, who shout it out, starting the business all over again. ''Not bad today,'' Lee says, surveying his buzzing empire. ''It's working.''    B - Edwidge Danticat Utica Avenue and Avenue D, East Flatbush  Edwidge Danticat is the author of ''Breath, Eyes, Memory'' and, most recently, ''The Farming of Bones.''  Gray overcast minute in East Flatbush, a mostly African-American and Caribbean neighborhood. Landmark: Taste the Tropics Ice Cream, its parrot-green awning half covered with a swirling rainbow, linking three palmettos to a giant ice-cream cone. Car horns blare as ''dollar cab'' drivers race to get to the B46 bus stop to scoop up passengers before the bus arrives. For an even dollar each, the elderly caramel-skinned woman in a nursing uniform and the young boy in crisp navy pants, white long-sleeved shirt and a navy Catholic school tie will ride down Utica Avenue in a sleek leather-interior Lincoln Town Car and reach their destinations much faster. The Lincoln darts in and picks them up just in time, before the bus arrives.    The co-owner of a new custom-upholstery shop, Austin wishes he could be somewhere else. ''In bed, maybe?'' Or perhaps on one of those trips advertised on yellow cardboard in the window of Astral Travel, across from Taste the Tropics. For $388, one can journey to Trinidad, Grenada or Haiti; a trip to Senegal, on this day of nines, is fittingly priced at $999.    M - Susan Minot West Ninth Street  Susan Minot is the author of ''Monkeys'' and, most recently, ''Evening.''  In the lobby, a fan is going on the battered desk. No doorman. A sign: ''They are working on the Elevator. Is out of order.'' I step outside. Down the street is the building that served as a model (built in a Hollywood studio) for ''Rear Window,'' Hitchcock's ode to voyeurism. No one this morning looks at one another. A stocky woman in a suit bustles toward the subway, rooting around for something in her bag; an Indian couple walks dreamily arm in arm; a woman with hair still wet holds her chin high. A man in a blue shirt tends his dog. The clock on the brick tower of the library, which used to be a courthouse, says 9:09. Walking toward me with a brisk pace is the shrink I used to see some years ago, someone who has peered in the window of many people's dramas and imbroglios and minutiae, mine included. She walks quickly by, not meeting my eye.    1,022,827 gallons of water and 7,890 megawatts of electricity flowed into New York City. 135,000 phone calls were placed or answered.    M - Al Gibson, Mike Panarella and James Mennella  3 Times Square  Fifty workers constructing the new Reuters Building on Seventh Avenue between 42nd and 43rd Streets were given disposable cameras to record the minute. Gibson and Panarella are crane operators on the project.    Q - Leigh Holtzin the N Train, between Queensboro Plaza, Queens, and Lexington Avenue, Manhattan    Q - Jan Staller Queens, construction of a new Water Tunnel    M - Marilyn Church 100 Centre Street  Judge Carol Edmead of Arraignment Court speaking with Michael Borba, the bridge officer who hands her the arraignments.    M - Ken Kerbs New York Stock Exchange    M - Grand and Forsyth Streets (left), broadway and wall street (right) Anthropology students from Barnard and Columbia collected garbage that was deposited in trash receptacles during the minute.    M - James Traub The United Nations  James Traub is a contributing writer for The Times Magazine.  Kofi Annan, secretary general of the United Nations, left an elevator with his bodyguard and entered a television studio where he was scheduled to tape two messages -- one to ''the world business community,'' the other to employees of Unesco, a U.N. agency. Annan, who had been preoccupied for weeks with the conflict in East Timor, sat down before a mirror to be made up. He was as still as a mannequin, and he wore the muted uniform of the institution man: navy suit, white shirt, red and blue tie. Annan's white hair and goatee made his large, sleepy eyes look impossibly black. When an aide stuck his head through the curtain and said sorrowfully, ''There is a problem with the teleprompter, sir,'' Annan remained expressionless for a moment and then said softly: ''I'll do it another time. Now I can go talk to East Timor.''    B - Nicholas Dawidoff Yankee Stadium  Nicholas Dawidoff is the author of ''The Catcher Was a Spy,'' a biography of Moe Berg, and ''In the Country of Country.''  Thomas Fyfe headed for the batter's box at Yankee Stadium. He carried a rake. Fyfe works as a groundskeeper at the most famous baseball field in America, and at 9:09 a.m. he stood alone on the vast green lawn surrounded by 57,746 empty seats, tamping and prodding the muddy clay around home plate. Pausing for a moment, Fyfe looked out across the dew-soaked outfield and noticed things only a groundskeeper sees.     In right field, a sea-gull feather lay on a tired stretch of sod that Fyfe refers to as ''O'Neill's spot'' -- a patch of grass the outfielder Paul O'Neill wears down with his vigorous pacing between pitches. An open gate in left-center revealed two tomatoes heavy on the vine in the bullpen garden. In shallow-left, near the stands, were two ballpoint pens, misplaced, Fyfe thought, by fans hoping to receive an autograph. ''Now's the best time in the world,'' he said. ''There's nobody here. You just come out and work.''    M - Cathleen Schine 76th and West End Avenue  Cathleen Schine is the author, most recently, of ''The Evolution of Jane.''  In ''The Pursuit of the Millennium,'' the historian Norman Cohn illustrates the five ways in which medieval millennialists identified salvation.     1. It will be collective.    We're here, together, waiting for the same thing. . . .     2. It will be realized on this earth.    Grinding din of workmen digging up street, heaviness of humidity. . . .     3. It is imminent.    Man on cell phone, hand held out with casual certainty. . . . Two women, both in black suits, competitors, eye each other, ready to pounce. . . .     4. It will be total -- utterly transforming life.    An undeniable truth in heavy rain. Or when it's freezing and you're not properly dressed. Or when you're late. Like increasingly frantic father with son's backpack. Mother, with squirming daughter, waving wildly. . . .     5. Finally, it will be miraculous.    Yes. Only one of blind mystical faith like the man with the cell phone, hand still out, can really expect one now. The others peer irritably into the distance. Lights atop yellow cabs unlighted -- inauspicious.     But then. . . . A golden gypsy slows, sparkles beside the believer, blinks its headlights. . . . Just one. . . . The left. . . . It's a sign!    It's a taxi.    M - Eleanor Randolph Astor Place  Eleanor Randolph is a member of the editorial board of The Times.  Jerry DeLakas stands alone in his compact green newsstand, surrounded by a panorama of urgent headlines. ''Virus Scare Grows'' shouts Page 1 of The Daily News -- mosquitoes have caused an outbreak of ''encephalitis,'' three deaths in a city of seven million people. Newsday features a postman with bug spray in his mailbag. The stand is oddly quiet. DeLakas smokes, a hazard made worse by his habit of storing his burning cigarette in the middle of a stack of magazines while he makes a sale. Suddenly a man in overalls rushes up, pays for a copy of the Spanish daily El Diario and then begins running back to the street. ''My truck stop there,'' he points to the reason for his urgency. ''No make me get ticket,'' he calls over his shoulder. With 10 seconds left in the minute, a lean man darts into the newsstand, grabs The New York Times, The New York Post and The Wall Street Journal and leaves a small wad of bills. Engrossed in his cell phone, he waves off the change, a far bigger deal clearly hanging in the balance. Only once does he slow down -- to explain to me that he cannot stop.    A sampling of the books returned to the Brooklyn Public Library in Grand Army Plaza: E.B. White, ''Charlotte's Web''; James Herbert, ''Portent''; David Eddings, ''Sorceress of Darshiva: Book Four of the Malloreon''; Amanda Quick, ''Reckless''; Wanda Ga'g, ''Millions of Cats.''    M - Alex Witchel Grand Central Terminal  Alex Witchel reports on style for The Times.  Her flowered skirt sways above her ankles, like curtains in a breeze. She makes her way intently around the circular beacon that is the Information Booth in Grand Central Terminal, oblivious to the streams of men charging off the escalators, wielding briefcases big and battered. She walks first past the red schedules, the green, then the blue, selecting one of each -- Westport, Greenwich, Tuckahoe -- as if she were choosing fruit.    She passes through the line of harried questioners (''Can you tell me how to go to Metuchen, N.J.?'') and drifts past the man who sets his coffee cup on the shelf holding the schedules, knocking some to the floor, where they lie, ignored.    Her journey complete, she files her stack carefully in her black shoulder bag. Knowing now how to get to every New York suburb at every hour of the day, she turns her back and heads toward the subway.    B - Charles Siebert Brooklyn Bridge  Charles Siebert is the author of the forthcoming ''Angus,'' a memoir of a dying dog.  At the top of the Brooklyn anchorage ramp, a well-heeled woman stops to wrestle a homeless man over the trash can he has just spilled onto the promenade, thrashes him with her briefcase, picks up scattered newspapers and puts them back in the container as he canes his way toward the next one.    Nearly 10 minutes gone of the official workday, these are the late crossers. No eased faces in the mounting heat, all grimace and climb, traffic so dense you worry for its destination, start counting the city's vertical panes against the passing eyes and windshields here, some incalculable yet daily resolved equation between the onslaught and the eventual settle. The sun slides into view. From unseen roadway scaffoldings below, jackhammers and lug wrench whines, the nuts and bolts, the underpinnings of flight being tended to.    M - Joan Liftin Washington Square Park    B - Erin Patrice O'Brien Beth Jacob School, Boro Park, Brooklyn    M - James Mennella 43rd Street and Seventh Avenue    M - Timothy (Speed) Levitch Sixth Avenue and Eighth Street    M - Benjamin H. Lee Washington Street, off 14th Street    B - Alex Tehrani Third Avenue and 149th street, The Bronx    B - Brenda Ann Kenneally Broadway and Kosciuszko Street, Bushwick, Brooklyn    M - Amanda Hesser Wall and Water Streets    M - Arlene Gottfried Sixth Avenue and 12th Street    M - David Shipley Greenwich Avenue and 10th Street    B - John Berendt Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn  John Berendt is the author of ''Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.''  Except for the distant drone of a lawn mower and the higher-pitched whapping sound of an edge trimmer somewhere out of sight, all is stillness on this grassy hilltop in New York's ''Garden City of the Dead.''    In the shadow of an imposing bronze statue of Minerva, Charles Higgins, the inventor of India ink, slumbers in a heavy, banklike mausoleum. Some yards behind him, the remains of the musician Leonard Bernstein lie under a simple marker set flush into the ground. Five small stones have been placed on it.    Half a million people are buried in this cemetery, and five more are lowered into it every day. They tell me that 135 groundskeepers maintain these 478 lush acres, but all I know is not a single living soul came into view during the minute I stood watch.    Esmeralda Santiago Southbound tollbooth plaza, Henry Hudson Bridge  Esmeralda Santiago is the author of ''When I Was Puerto Rican'' and, most recently, ''Almost a Woman.''  A Dodge Intrepid cuts in front of a Lexus. The Lexus driver curses and gives the finger to the Intrepid, which then weaves in front of an Eclipse. An Explorer sidles up to a Beetle, hovers next to it until its driver notices, then signals right. A Navigator balks between the Cash Only and E-ZPass lanes, blocking everyone behind. A Pathfinder noses the Navigator, which stops dead in its tracks. A yellow cab takes advantage of the Navigator's hesitation and guns in front of it, followed by a Caravan. An Expedition tries to make the same move, but the Navigator lurches forward, heading, finally, triumphantly, for the E-ZPass.    One arrival at Newark International Airport (US Airways Flight 1122, from Pittsburgh) and one departure (Continental Flight 1083, to West Palm Beach, Fla.). One departure at La Guardia (United Airlines Flight 347, to Denver). No arrivals or departures at John F. Kennedy International.    B - Harvey Shapiro Brooklyn Promenade  Harvey Shapiro is the author, most recently, of ''Selected Poems.''  There they are  the water-hugging giants of Manhattan  breathing the dun-colored air of morning.  Silent, mysterious  seen through a white scrim of fog.    Directly beneath me, commuter traffic  of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway.  Across that, on the Brooklyn docks  one lone forklift tractor, loaded with steel rods,  jockeying back and forth  before the Strober Bros. Building Supply Depot.  Across the water, dimly descried,  nested in the green arches of Battery,  a perky yellow Staten Island Ferry.    But the buildings pulsing in their various  shades of white  and now, as the fog thins slowly,  a pale dusty blue, out of Giotto,  seems to descend behind them.    These mighty presences at the end of  Manhattan Island,  fronting the East River that is not a river  but a tidal strait carrying  the North Atlantic to our very doorstep.    These monuments that dominate our day  as if they had been fixed there forever  though they are in flux as the waters are in flux.    They stand before us  like tribal gods meting out success and unsuccess,  all that we have to lift our eyes to.    M - Pete Hamill Broadway and Canal Street  Pete Hamill, former editor of The Daily News, is the author, most recently, of an illustrated biography of Diego Rivera.  At 9:09, the street light changes and trucks roar into life along Canal, crossing Broadway, heading east to the Manhattan Bridge, west to the Holland Tunnel: gru, gru, grug, gu-grug, groooaaaaar. Pedestrians rush across Broadway: two Chinese girls in high heels speaking English; a tan woman with a dragon tattooed on her bare back, sipping coffee as she walks; a fat guy in a Ralph Lauren shirt hurrying across on dainty feet right behind four students with backpacks and baggy jeans. All easing past one another, avoiding collisions, hurrying. A young Latina woman, copper-haired in the morning sun, wearing a tailored tan suit and carrying a briefcase, strides through the jumbled crowd, cutting a path. A large woman in a blue dress pauses to light a cigarette, her face desperate and sweaty, while others move around her. A tiny gray-haired Chinese woman in slacks and blouse, carrying a heavy shopping bag, hurries along, as the light turns to DONT WALK and a Bell Atlantic truck makes an abrupt turn out of Canal, heading directly at her. She freezes in the truck's path. The driver stops, gives her a small wave; she nods and waves back and hurries on, into her American morning.    M - Jack Pierson Churchill Park, Bleecker and Downing Streets    B - Yvette M. Sohl Central Avenue, Bushwick, Brooklyn    M - Nina Berman Central Park West and 81st Street  Madeline Greenberg, in her apartment, gets some help from her nurse, Judy Dennis.    B - Angel Franco Viele and Tiffany Avenues, Hunts Point, The South Bronx  Roxxanne, a 27-year-old prostitute, in front of the lot where she lives. Originally from Maine, she came to New York 12 years ago.    M - Carrie Boretz  P.S. 165, West 109th Street  Genesis Frias is not at all happy about returning to school. Struggling all the way, she is led into her first day of second grade.    M - Julia Topolski  West Ninth Street, between Broadway and University Place    M - Lewis Lapham The Carlyle Hotel dining room, Madison Avenue at 76th Street  Lewis Lapham is the editor of Harper's Magazine and the author, most recently, of ''Lapham's Rules of Influence.''  A high-ceilinged room decorated with the reassuring signs of serious money: English hunting scenes by Fores on walls faced with brown velvet, fresh flowers (Casablanca lilies and curly willow) against a background of old botany (the engravings by Redoute), the pattern of the breakfast china matched to the chintz on the center banquette, the coffee priced at $5, the poached eggs on smoked salmon at $22.50. The 28 tables accommodate a tasteful selection of fine guests, as reassuring as the decor in their dress and appearance: custom-made shirts, German accents, warm suntans lately arrived from Cape Cod and California, a small but important collection of gold jewelry. The two men rising from the table near the door -- Robert Rubin, recently resigned as the secretary of the Treasury, and Richard Holbrooke, newly confirmed as the ambassador to the United Nations -- gather their papers and close their briefcases. They nod to people in remote corners of the room, and as they walk out into the lobby, the matre d'htel bows to them with a grateful smile, acknowledging their fitness to be seen in the company of horses by Fores, watches from Breguet, the lily by Redoute.    Frank McCourt 345 East 15th Street  Frank McCourt is the author, most recently, of '''Tis.''  It is the first day of the academic year for the High School for Health Professions and Human Services. This is where I used to teach, from 1969 to 1987, back when Stuyvesant High School was in this building.    Students crowd the sidewalks between First and Second Avenues. They sit on the steps of the old brownstones opposite their school. They also lean against cars, triggering alarms, which they then imitate. They laugh till security guards or other adults from the school ask them to please stay off the cars. The students are polite, but when the adults go back into the building, they relax against the cars again.    Along the street, there are reunions, cries and hugs. Hi, Joey. Hi, Miranda. Wow, you lost weight. Love your hair.    The student population seems to be largely African-American, with smaller groups of Hispanics and Asians and an even smaller group of whites. When I taught here, the population was mostly Jewish, though as the years went on it became increasingly Asian. The school bell rings, and the boxes, bags and bottles containing foods and drinks must be disposed of. Adults from the school ask the students to please pick up their garbage and put it in the can, but there is litter and the school year has begun.    Zero births and deaths reported in New York City. 7,420,166 estimated population.    S - Bastienne Schmidt New Brighton, Staten Island  It's breakfast time for Philippe Cheng and his 6-month-old son, Max.    M - Garry Trudeau Fifth Avenue and 84th Street    The Alignment of The Heavens www.astrology.net    B - Deborah Mesa-Pelly Remsen Street, Brooklyn Heights    B - Phillip Lopate Carroll Park, Brooklyn  Phillip Lopate is the editor of ''The Art of the Essay,'' an annual anthology.  Four hefty Italian-American moms sit around the picnic benches, drinking iced espressos while their kids dash around. A father, middle-aged like me (Oh, the sticky solicitous doting of graybeard dads!), tenderly picks up his boy to take him to the bathroom in the dignified stone park house. Another father lifts his tan-frocked daughter up to grab the parallel bars, then says, ''Play with something else,'' and heads for a bench. He's teaching her ''independence,'' meanwhile grabbing a few private moments. She skulks over the standard-issue climbing structure, probably thinking, Why do adults insist on pretending it's fun to play by yourself?     This park is the glue that holds our (suddenly trendy) neighborhood together, the one public space that equalizes newcomers and old-timers, haves and have-nots. In their corner, black nannies with white babies discuss in island accents the chances of finding other employment. Across, a woman trains her son to take toddler steps, while absent-mindedly picking lint from her yellow blouse. A huge-bellied man snoozes on a bench, his shopping cart filled with collected bottles.    Excerpts from the Dow Jones news ticker, Times Square: TOKYO STOCKS CLOSE 0.2% HIGHER AFTER JAPAN'S G.D.P.

Homes Crunch gym, 404 Lafayette Street  A.M. Homes is the author of ''Music for Torching,''a novel.  In front of me are hindquarters -- three women on StairMasters, pushing to the top. To my left, a famous foreign correspondent, on a Precor EFX544 Crosstrainer. He reads papers damp with sweat, turning the pages and then shedding them to the floor, leaving a pile of news all around him. On the treadmill next to me, a gray-haired guy, cell phone clipped to his shorts. He runs at 5.8 m.p.h., panting. His phone rings. ''I don't know,'' he barks. ''I don't know anything.''    At the juice bar, someone orders a Chocolate Monkey with soy protein. Overhead hangs a bank of TV's, close-captioned for the hearing impaired. On the exercise channel, a group of 20 does tricep exercises in unison. The CNBC ticker tape flows while Martha Stewart's mother suggests adding pineapple to the rice pudding; Martha, justifiably suspicious, offers that maybe raisins would be more traditional.    A commercial for Final Fantasy IV flashes across the screen, and the gray-haired guy is ringing again. ''Are we winning?'' he asks, splashing sweat onto my controls. ''That's all I want to know, are we winning?''    M - Darcy Frey WEST 72nd Street  Darcy Frey is the author of ''The Last Shot.''  Location: Small, well-appointed office, decorated with sprawling vines and South American artifacts, in an apartment building. Two men face each other in leather armchairs. On an ottoman between them sits a tape recorder.  Patient: Last night, I had all sorts of performance-anxiety dreams.  Analyst: Such as?  Patient: Well, I dreamt I was in some sort of stage production and I couldn't remember any of my lines.  Analyst: Yes?  Patient: And the woman I was doing the scene with, she couldn't remember any of her lines, either. [Through the open window comes the squeal of truck brakes.] To be honest, I think it's about my doubts and anxieties about being in therapy.  Analyst: Let's stay with the dream for a moment. Where does the dream take place?  Patient: I can't remember.  Analyst: And the woman -- who was she? [The piercing cry of a car alarm is heard.]  Patient: I can't remember.  Analyst: Well, what did she look like?  Patient: I can't remember.  Analyst: Well, was she someone you were romantically involved with? [A jackhammer starts up. Analyst and patient raise their voices.]  Patient: No, she was someone I'd been paired with artificially.  Analyst: And why do you think this is about therapy?  Patient: Well, talk about an artificial situation!    M - Michael Pollan Central Park  Michael Pollan is a contributing writer for the magazine.  ''It's hideous out there,'' warned the radio. ''Hazy, hot and humid'' was the forecast, and by 9:09 it was already all of that. But hideous? Not where I was.    Where I was was on the terrace of Belvedere Castle, the rough midpoint and actual high point of Central Park, and the precise spot where New York City's weather is measured by an ensemble of meteorological instruments. At 9:09, the official readings were as follows: temperature, 24 C; dew point, 22 C; relative humidity, 87 percent; visibility, 1 1/2 miles in mist; barometric pressure, 29.87.    Here are some other, unofficial readings as of 9:09, collected by five different instruments temporarily installed at the same location:    Eyes: Looking north over the Great Lawn, a milky haze hangs in the trees, throwing the blocky crenelations edging the park slightly out of focus. The effect is like standing at the bottom of a large white teacup, the haze curving up the sides to an indistinct rim circling above; only directly overhead is the pale blue of the sky visible. Below, five mallards moving east etch overlapping V's in the green pane of Turtle Pond. Eight turtles nap on a narrow ledge of schist, all presenting themselves to the sun at precisely the same angle. Across the pond, six stagehands are striking the set at the Delacorte Theater. A woman in a Sullivan & Cromwell T-shirt Rollerblades along the perimeter of the Great Lawn, which is being mowed. A belated wisteria bloom, one of summer's (and millennium's) last, hangs in the crown of a cherry tree.    Skin: Right cheek registers an intense circle of radiant heat originating at the 2 o'clock position in the eastern sky.     Tongue: Tang of salt, from the perspiration beading upper lip.    Ears: The drone of traffic across the 79th Street transverse, steady as an air-conditioner until broken by the diesel laboring of a crosstown bus. A jet rising from La Guardia slowly churns the air, then fades, opening a parenthesis for the warble of a bird. Echo-y hammer taps rise from the stagehands, who have switched on a boom box or radio: jazz.     Nose: The moist, unmoving air holds each smell in a kind of suspension. There is cut grass; there is decadent pond; there is dumpster; there is hot-dog steam.    M - Jhumpa Lahiri Cooper Station Post Office, Fourth Avenue and 11th Street  Jhumpa Lahiri is the author of ''Interpreter of Maladies,'' a collection of short stories.  A man affixes 33-cent stamps to a pile of purple envelopes. The envelopes are stiff, full of promise, elegantly addressed in bold black strokes. The stamps, self-adhesive, have pink roses on them. The man wears a plaid shirt, khaki shorts, brown shoes and black socks pulled up to his calves. He stands at a table, covered with pale green glass, supported by golden columns. A brass plate runs down the center of the table, with empty round receptacles where there once may have been sponges for moistening stamps. Voices echo in the post office. Heels clip across the floor. The man works solemnly, methodically, about to see a long project to its end. Above his head, a digital clock.Time is running out to the year 2000,'' the clock's backing says: 113 days, 14 hours, 50 minutes, a few seconds to go.

I would imagine 1,000 years from now it'll be automatic, making the dough and getting the fillings ready. Everything will be the same size, same way, identical. Handmade you can tell the difference: some are rounder; some are fatter; some have a little more filling. Anything done by machine has no feeling.

We will be measuring our time from the birth of Mr. Mickey Mouse. Mickey is the most famous corporate logo in the world, and his power over us is accelerating at the present time. We must resist this. How do we do that? Right now we don't have a clear strategy. Right now, Mickey Mouse and his handlers are in the ascendancy. . . . I have a vision . . . of erasing Mickey Mouse's face. Nothing is left of it. Times Square again becomes a place where the sidewalks are populated by real people! Visionaries. Sex workers. Blarney Stone experiencers. People sagging in the doorways. Hallelujah. That's the future! Amen! Praise be! I'm going to get back to my Western omelet right now. Nice to talk to you.    M - Beth Fertig Manhattan Criminal Court  Mr. Black [he wouldn't give full name]: Nineteen-ninety-nine is the beginning of the end. Everything is getting worse. Anyone selling drugs gets football number -- 55 years, lifetime sentences. Cocaine or weed. I'm here for selling weed, they say. I didn't put a gun to anyone's head. I'm just trying to feed my kids.    M - Verlyn Klinkenborg 38th Street and Sixth Avenue  Verlyn Klinkenborg writes editorials for The Times. He is the author of ''Making Hay'' and ''The Last Fine Time.''  What does this lot lack that makes it ''vacant''? Tenants larger than the 13 pigeons resting there. Foliage more ornamental than the low weeds growing in a solid mat near the 38th Street sidewalk. Dwellings more substantial than the construction trailer parked beside a sign announcing ''Another Gotham Construction Project.'' Commerce more consequential than the sticker pasted to a fence post advertising a Millennium Marijuana March in May 2000. Will the march take place? Will construction begin? Will the pigeons fly? Nothing happens here except time and the roosting of pigeons. And yet the sound of the street -- an overcast roar -- is subtly changed by the cubic absence, the nearly inaudible silence this vacant lot offers the city.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/05/magazine/a-new-york-minute.html,,"As we contemplated what people a thousand years from now might want to know about us, a question naturally arose: what's missing from our picture of the world a thousand years ago? One answer was obvious: a sense of the experience of everyday life -- the sights, sounds and sensations that time washes away almost instantly. For the Times Capsule, we set out to document the texture of life today, at least in a single place at a single moment. And so, on Sept. 9, 1999, at 9:09 a.m., a moment chosen strictly for its symmetry, more than a hundred writers, photographers, artists, sound recordists, filmmakers and students fanned out across the five boroughs to document a single minute -- the same minute -- in the life of New York. They came back with a mosaic of 60 ordinary seconds that will, we hope, last a millennium.",6,157,The New York Times,,,1999-12-05T05:00:00+0000,article,Magazine Desk,Magazine,News,nyt://article/37d977f0-863c-5ff4-987e-6ca1138394ef,5919,nyt://article/37d977f0-863c-5ff4-987e-6ca1138394ef,NA,A New York Minute,NA,NA,A New York Minute,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,358,340,47

He had never noticed it and decided to see where it led; after a short drive, he found himself amid a strange encampment. Withers stepped out of his truck and looked around. Cheerful, rickety houses sprouted from the ground like unclassified fungi, or something dreamed up by Lewis Carroll, but what appealed to him most was the barn; on the side, in large yellow letters, someone had written ‘‘Welcome Home.’’ Withers walked up to a shack that appeared to be inhabited and — overtaken by curiosity — he knocked. The woman who came out looked surprised. She told him that he was on a commune for gay, lesbian and transgender people and suggested politely that he leave. Later, Withers called his friend Neal Appelbaum, the openly gay director of the arts center in neighboring Cannon County, and told him about what he saw. Appelbaum explained that Withers had stumbled into Ida, a commune for queer vegetarians; the entire region was home to maybe a dozen rural planned communities for L.G.B.T.Q. people, a kind of sexually nonconforming Amish country. He also pointed out that the fading sign on the barn didn’t say ‘‘Welcome Home.’’ The last letter was not an ‘‘e’’ but an ‘‘o.’’",MM,42,The New York Times,,,2015-08-06T11:00:18+0000,article,Magazine,Magazine,News,nyt://article/e3545412-f1f4-5837-8419-6c3719029c94,5320,nyt://article/e3545412-f1f4-5837-8419-6c3719029c94,NA,Out of the Woods,Feature,NA,Out of the Woods,NA,NA,NA,By Alex Halberstadt,,NA,358,340,47

They decorate their bowers with scores of colorful objects, like flowers, berries, snail shells or, if they are near an urban area, bottle caps and plastic cutlery.

Based on historical fact, José Rivera's new play is about two days that Che Guevera spent trapped in a one-room schoolhouse. A co-production with the Labyrinth Theater company. John Ortiz and Patricia Velasquez star. (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200.    'SUMMER PLAY FESTIVAL' Starts Wednesday. Through July 30. Fifteen emerging playwrights, including Peter Morris and Etan Frankel, strut their stuff in this eclectic annual showcase. Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200.    Broadway    * 'BRIDGE & TUNNEL' (Tony Award, Special Theatrical Event 2006) This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Ben Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, Best Book of a Musical and Best Original Score 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    *'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, Best Play and Best Direction of a Play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood)    'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    *'SHINING CITY' Quiet, haunting and absolutely glorious. Conor McPherson's impeccably assembled ghost story about being alone in the crowded city of Dublin has been brought to American shores with a first-rate cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Oliver Platt, Martha Plimpton and Peter Scanavino), directed by Robert Falls (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    * 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, Best Direction of a Musical 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE WEDDING SINGER'  An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Broadway    'BURLEIGH GRIME$' A feeble-witted comedy by Roger Kirby about dirty dealings on Wall Street, featuring a pair of skilled actors known for recent television work -- Wendie Malick of ''Just Shoot Me'' and Mark Moses of ''Desperate Housewives'' -- and incidental music by David Yazbek, who wrote the score for Broadway's ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.'' These putative assets are painfully ill served by Mr. Kirby's play, which is long on ludicrous plot and short on fresh humor. (2:10). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'THE BUSY WORLD IS HUSHED' With the Episcopal church in a tizzy about homosexuality and that intriguing new gospel of Judas the subject of much speculation, Keith Bunin's play about conflicts of family and of faith arrives at a propitious moment. Jill Clayburgh stars as an Episcopal minister with a troublesome son and what may be an undiscovered Gospel. Engaging, if a little too tidy (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)    'THE FIELD'  John B. Keane's portrait of rural life in Ireland in the mid-20th century, both sorrowful and censorious. This sturdy new production, directed by Ciaran O'Reilly, features Marty Maguire as Bull McCabe, a tough farmer who will stop at nothing to preserve his right to raise his cattle on a field about to be auctioned. A little moralistic, but powerful nonetheless (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'NOT A GENUINE BLACK MAN' Brian Copeland's solo memoir about his African-American family moving into a white suburb in the early 1970's is an engaging, if stiltedly performed, show (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)    'PIG FARM' A gleefully stupid comedy by Greg Kotis about lust and violence in the farm belt, with a few gristly bits of satire aimed at the fat-bellied American electorate thrown in for good measure. Powered by the frenzied commitment of the four skilled actors who make up its cast, the comedy careers around the stage like an interminable improv session for a still-unformulated sketch on ''Saturday Night Live.'' (2:15). Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)    'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'SOME GIRL(S)' A slight and sour comedy from Neil LaBute that once again puts a morally bankrupt man under the microscope and watches him squirm. The central specimen is here played by Eric McCormack, who as a thoughtless heterosexual gives much the same performance he did as a thoughtful homosexual on ''Will and Grace.'' Jo Bonney directs a cast that also includes Fran Drescher, Judy Reyes, Brooke Smith and Maura Tierney as women done wrong by the same man (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)    * 'SPRING AWAKENING' German schoolboys of the 19th century frolic like rockers in this adventurous new musical adapted from the 1891 play by Frank Wedekind about sex, death and adolescence. Staged with élan by Michael Mayer, and featuring alluringly melancholy music by the pop singer-songwriter Duncan Sheik, this is a flawed but vibrant show that stretches the stage musical in new directions (2:10). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)    'SUSAN AND GOD' The Mint Theater Company's fine revival of Rachel Crothers's 1937 comedy about religion, career and family features Leslie Hendrix of ''Law & Order,'' excellent in the role of Susan. Jonathan Bank directs (2:20). The Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, third floor, Clinton, (212) 315-0231.(George Hunka)    'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)    'TREASON' The poet Ezra Pound was a repellent fellow, judging from this play by Sallie Bingham: racist, anti-Semitic, eager to exploit the affections of the women who loved him. Just why women were drawn to him is never clear, but the play is thoughtful, and the acting, especially by Philip Pleasants as Pound, is superb (2:10). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger)    'THE WATER'S EDGE' In a bold surgical endeavor that recalls the experiments of the mad Dr. Frankenstein, Theresa Rebeck has tried to transplant the big, blood-engorged heart of a Greek tragedy into the slender body of a modest American comic drama. The resulting hybrid runs amok in a stylishly acted production, directed by Will Frears and starring Kate Burton and Tony Goldwyn (2:00). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Brantley)    Long-Running Shows    * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)    'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30).Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'ARABIAN NIGHT' A blonde in a German apartment building sleeps too much; the super takes an unexpected trip to the desert; and a peeping Tom is properly punished in this stylish comedy whose title turns out to make perfect sense (1:05). The East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200; closes tomorrow. (Gates)    'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright, Yussef El Guindi, addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after Sept. 11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101; closes tomorrow. (Genzlinger)    'CRAZY FOR THE DOG' Christopher Boal's effective family melodrama about a brother, a sister, a wife and a boyfriend caught in a web of recrimination and confession, touched off by the kidnapping of a shih tzu (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 677-0060, Ext. 16; closes on Sunday. (Hunka)    'ELVIS AND JULIET'  This opposites-collide tale by Mary Willard and starring her husband, the television actor Fred Willard, looks like community theater and is just as unoriginal. The title characters are young lovers, he the son of an Elvis impersonator, she the daughter of overeducated snobs. Fred dons an Elvis suit, but it's not enough (2:15). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Genzlinger)    'GETTING HOME' Anton Dudley's Valentine's Day card to New York, in which three lonely lovers finally find love in unexpected places, directed by David Schweizer. Determinedly angst-free (1:20). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 246-4422; closes tomorrow. (Hunka)    'THE GOLD STANDARD' A successful alumnus, his trophy girlfriend and an eccentric Korean professor form a romantic triangle at a campus bar in Daniel Roberts's drama, which is occasionally original but often downright odd (2:30). The Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow. (Gates)    'THE HOUSE IN TOWN'  A wan new drama by Richard Greenberg about an American marriage slowly imploding in the days before the country's economy did the same, more suddenly and spectacularly, back in 1929. A miscast Jessica Hecht stars as Amy Hammer, a well-to-do housewife sliding into despair as her remote husband looks on in frustration. Doug Hughes's production is pretty but desultory, as is Mr. Greenberg's typically eloquent but atypically empty writing (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Brantley)    * 'THE MOST WONDERFUL LOVE' Blue Coyote Theater Group has a rollicking good time with this inventive tale of domestic disintegration by Matthew Freeman. Mother (Lenni Benicaso) and Father (Frank Anderson), after long years together, decide to ''unmarry,'' which isn't quite the same as divorce but just as unsettling for their already unsettled youngest child (Josephine Stewart). But that doesn't begin to convey how nutty this play is. Access Theater, 380 Broadway, at White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow. (Genzlinger)    'NERVE' In Adam Szymkowicz's romantic comedy, an online couple's first date is a frightening but satisfyingly comic escalation of confessions and demands (1:00). 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow.(Gates)    'NOTHING' A morsel of catnip for Anglophiles, flavorfully adapted by Andrea Hart from the novel by Henry Green. Simon Dutton and Sophie Ward play onetime lovers contemplating the possible marriage of their children in this comedy of manners about the string of upheavals that a romance in one generation causes in another (1:40). The 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)    'SATELLITES' This tough-minded, soft-hearted and very likable play by Diana Son (''Stop Kiss'') portrays a world in which traditional ethnic, social, economic and sexual boundaries have become so porous that people are never quite sure who or where they are. Sandra Oh and Kevin Carroll play a couple who move into a Brooklyn brownstone that refuses (literally) to stay still. Michael Greif directs the appropriately fluid ensemble. (1:40). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Brantley)    'STOPPING TRAFFIC' The actress Mary Pat Gleason's endearing one-woman show about making movies (and just getting through life) while bipolar is a play with both a message and some hearty laughs (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303; closes on Sunday. (Gates)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    * 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott)    * 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing.(Manohla Dargis)    'THE BLOOD OF MY BROTHER' (No rating, 84 minutes, in English and Arabic) Another documentary about the occupation of Iraq; another heartbreak; another protest; another dead brother; another necessity. (Nathan Lee)    'THE BREAK-UP' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn split up and share custody of a Chicago condominium. Dull and cheerless, notwithstanding a handful of funny supporting turns, notably from Judy Davis and Jason Bateman. (Scott)    'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3D toon from Pixar just putt, putt, putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis)    * 'CAVITE' (No rating, 80 minutes, in English and Tagalog) Terrorism and cultural identity are only two of the themes wound into a tight knot of fear and bewilderment in this gripping, no-budget political thriller shot on the fly with hand-held cameras that scour the teeming streets and squatter shacks of Cavite, a city on the outskirts of Manila. (Stephen Holden)  'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis)    * 'LEONARD COHEN: I'M YOUR MAN' (PG-13, 104 minutes) This enthralling documentary combines pieces of an extended interview with Mr. Cohen, the Canadian singer-songwriter, poet, and author, now 71, with a tribute concert at the Sydney Opera House in January 2005. Nick Cave, Rufus Wainwright, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, Martha Wainwright, and Antony are among the featured performers. (Holden)     'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott)    * 'DOWN IN THE VALLEY' (R, 114 minutes) This allegorical neo-western set in the San Fernando Valley has dreams as big as the fantasies that consume its protagonist, a Stetson-wearing suburban cowboy (Edward Norton) who is not what he appears to be. How much you like it will depend on your appetite for the kind of cultural metaphors that David Jacobson flings onto the screen with a reckless abandon. (Holden)    'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT' (PG-13, 98 minutes) The ''Fast and Furious'' formula (dudes + cars + babes = $) is recycled in Tokyo, where the cars are smaller, and the clothes are kookier, but the boys are still boys. (Lee)    * 'GARDEN OF EARTHLY DELIGHTS'  (No rating, 103 minutes) Affected but elegant, this digital video ''Death in Venice'' follows an art historian and her lover as they grapple, frequently in the buff, with life, death and the iconography of Bosch. (Lee)    'GARFIELD: A TAIL OF TWO KITTIES'  (PG, 80 minutes) It was the worst of times. (Dargis)    'THE HIDDEN BLADE' (R, 132 minutes, in Japanese) Set in 1861 at the tail end of Japanese feudalism, ''The Hidden Blade'' focuses on a gentle samurai balancing his love for a low-caste servant girl and his mission to kill a traitorous friend. By taking samurai-movie conventions and placing them in the harsh light of daily survival, the director, Yoji Yamada, is illuminating the twilight of an entire way of life. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    'KEEPING UP WITH THE STEINS' (PG-13, 84 minutes) A rollicking bar mitzvah comedy begins as a growling, razor-toothed satire of carnivorous consumption in Hollywood. But after the first half-hour, those growls subside into whimpers, and the fangs are retracted, and the movie morphs turns into a feel-good family comedy oozing good vibes. (Holden)    'THE KING' (R, 105 minutes) James Marsh uses clichés and some lived-in emotions and atmosphere for his fitfully engaging, exasperating film about a young Mexican-American (Gael García Bernal) whose search for his patrimony leads him into the bosom of a deeply religious Texas family (headed by a very fine William Hurt). (Dargis)    'THE LAKE HOUSE' (PG, 108 minutes) Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, reunited 12 years after ''Speed,'' play would-be lovers separated by time and yet somehow able to communicate. The absolute preposterousness of this teary romance is inseparable from its charm, which is greater than you might expect. (Scott)    'LAND OF THE BLIND' (R, 111 minutes) Watching this simplistic Orwellian fable set in a composite Everycountry that swings politically from extreme right to extreme left is like poring over a quadruple exposure. It's a jumble of ideas and images. (Holden)     'LOVERBOY' (R, 86 minutes) This cautionary mother-child drama, directed by Kevin Bacon, is a star vehicle for his wife, Kyra Sedgwick, who plays a pathologically possessive single mother. After starting out warm and fuzzy, this tonally uncertain film stealthily pulls out the rug until you suddenly find yourself standing on a cold stone floor, barefoot and shivering. (Holden)    'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III' (PG-13, 126 minutes) Er, this time it's personal, as Tom Cruise plays a dashing operative for a clandestine organization who sweeps a simpering brunette off her feet. Directed, without much flair, by J. J. Abrams, the small-screen auteur behind ''Lost'' and ''Alias.'' (Dargis)    * 'LA MOUSTACHE' (No rating, 86 minutes, in French) Emmanuel Carrière's psychological mystery prepares you to bask in one of those sexy, bittersweet marital comedies that are a hallmark of sophisticated French cinema. Then, by degrees, it subverts those expectations to spiral down a rabbit hole of ambiguity and doubt. (Holden)    * 'NACHO LIBRE' (PG, 91 minutes) A sweet bliss-out from the writers Mike White, Jerusha Hess and Jared Hess, who also directed, that finds a glorious Jack Black as a half-Mexican, half-Scandinavian monastery cook who aches to belong to another brotherhood, that of the luchadores, or masked wrestlers. (Dargis)    'THE OMEN' (R, 110 minutes) The supremely unnecessary remake of ''The Omen,'' the 1976 horror show that, along with ''Rosemary's Baby'' and ''The Exorcist,'' plunked everyone's favorite baddie, Satan, into the Hollywood mainstream, wants to capitalize on the tabloid theology in the air. Except for a few contemporary touches (the World Trade Center in flames as a portent of Armageddon) it slavishly recycles the original. (Holden)    'ONLY HUMAN' (No rating, 85 minutes, in Spanish) When a Jewish girl takes her Palestinian fiancé home to meet the parents, the encounter sets off a series of zany, romantic and potentially tragic misadventures during one eventful night in Madrid. (Laura Kern)    'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis)    * 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott)    * 'ROOM' (No rating, 75 minutes) Engulfed by nightmares, blackouts and the anxieties of the age, a Texas woman flees homeland insecurity for a New York vision quest in this acute, resourceful and bracingly ambitious debut film. (Lee)    'RUSSIAN DOLLS' (No rating, 129 minutes, in English, Russian, French and Spanish) The sequel to the international hit ''L'Auberge Espagnole'' belongs to a long line of airy French films that induce a pleasant buzz of Euro-envy. Like its forerunner, it is a generational group portrait of young, smart, sexy, well-educated Europeans at work and play filmed in a style that might be called Truffaut Lite. (Holden)    'SAY UNCLE' (R, 90 minutes) A comedy about a suspected gay pedophile is something even Mel Brooks might balk at, but ''Say Uncle'' would have benefited from his ability to turn bad taste into a good feature. When a childlike artist (Peter Paige, who also writes and directs) indulges his unhealthy, if innocent, interest in other people's children, a lynch mob of local moms is formed to hunt him down. Aspiring to address gay persecution and social paranoia, the movie mostly comes off as a study of arrested development. (Catsoulis)    'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis)    * 'TWO DRIFTERS' (No rating, 98 minutes, in Portuguese) From the dexterous mind of João Pedro Rodrigues comes a bizarre love triangle like no other. Two gay boys (one of whom is dead) are reunited with the help of an enigmatic girl on roller skates in a metaphysical melodrama about grief, love, hysterical pregnancy and the transmigration of souls. (Lee)    'UNITED 93' (R, 115 minutes) A scrupulously tasteful Hollywood re-creation of the downing of the fourth plane hijacked by Muslim terrorists on Sept. 11 and easily the feel-bad American movie of the year. Written and directed by Paul Greengrass, whose earlier films include ''Bloody Sunday.'' (Dargis)    'WASSUP ROCKERS' (R, 105 minutes) The latest provocation from the director and photographer Larry Clark follows a group of teenage Hispanic skateboarders from South Central Los Angeles on a 24-hour adventure that takes them from one hell (the inner city) to another (decadent Beverly Hills) and back. (Holden)    * 'WHO KILLED THE ELECTRIC CAR?' (PG, 92 minutes) A murder mystery, a call to arms and an effective inducement to rage, Chris Paine's film about the recent rise and fall of the electric car is the latest and one of the more successful additions to the growing ranks of issue-oriented documentaries. ( Dargis)    'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis)    Film Series    AFRO-PUNK WEEKEND (Through Tuesday) BAMcinématek's second annual program of films about revolution begins today. Films to be screened include Sandra Dickson and Churchill Roberts's ''Negroes With Guns'' (2004), the story of Robert Williams, a founder of the Black Panthers and advocate of armed resistance; ''Paris Is Burning'' (1990), Jennie Livingston's portrait of drag queens and self-invention; and ''Punk: Attitude'' (2005), a documentary about the origins of punk from Don Letts, co-founder of the band Big Audio Dynamite. 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10.

Sunday's feature is the comedy masterpiece ''Some Like It Hot'' (1959), about an all-women band that includes Marilyn Monroe and, strangely enough, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-9110; $10. (Gates)    STANLEY KUBRICK RETROSPECTIVE (Through July 9) The Museum of the Moving Image's five-week series continues this weekend with ''A Clockwork Orange'' (1971), starring Malcolm McDowell as a young, violent type from the near future, and ''Barry Lyndon'' (1975), Kubrick's Thackeray adaptation starring Ryan O'Neal as an 18th-century Irish social climber. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077; $10.

(Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    * BELLE AND SEBASTIAN (Tuesday) For a decade now, these members of Scottish indie royalty have made some of the most tasteful chamber pop on the planet: calm and elegant and clever, though sometimes a little bloodless. But the band loosened up a bit for its latest, ''The Life Pursuit'' (Matador), adding some bluesy vamps and -- could it be? -- some rock 'n' roll. At 3:30 p.m., the Lawn at Battery Park, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789; free, but tickets are required. (Ben Sisario)    KURTIS BLOW (Thursday) The City Parks Foundation's series of free concerts in parks throughout the five boroughs begins in Brooklyn with Kurtis Blow, who became one of the first heroes of rap with strutting and innocently street-smart rhymes like ''The Breaks'' (''Brakes on a bus, brakes on a car/ Breaks to make you a superstar''). At 7 p.m., Von King Park, Marcy and Tompkins Avenues, Bedford-Stuyvesant, (212) 360-8290; free. (Sisario)    BROKEN SOCIAL SCENE (Thursday) This Toronto collective has mastered a kind of free-associative indie-prog, following melodies and rhythmic patterns along endlessly fascinating tangents. The band plays a benefit concert for the Celebrate Brooklyn series, with the Hidden Cameras, another inventive and well-populated Toronto band. At 6 p.m., Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 855-7882 or (866) 468-7619; $30. (Sisario)    JOHNNY DOWD; MARY LORSON AND SAINT LOW (Thursday) Johnny Dowd applies his stoic Texas twang to songs about passion, sin and death; his band plays a version of honky-tonk that sounds as if it has been dragged through a swamp and encrusted with misfiring electronics. Mary Lorson, who was at the core of the band Madder Rose, has a pensive undertow behind her airy voice, floating in tunes that blend a folky delicacy with the lilt of jazz. Fans of Suzanne Vega or Mazzy Star owe it to themselves to discover her. At 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $12. (Jon Pareles)    FUTUREHEADS (Tonight) The Futureheads, from the northern English city of Sunderland, play tight, nervy and exhilarating little tantrums of guitar, with four-part chants and an endless supply of clever riffs. The band's first album, released two years ago, was one of the best by the many recent bands to resuscitate the angular postpunk of Gang of Four and Wire, and its new one, ''News and Tributes'' (Star Time/Vagrant), shows that it was no accident. With the French Kicks. At 6:30, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $22 in advance, $24 at the door. (Sisario)    GIPSY KINGS (Thursday) Strumming half a dozen guitars, singing in a husky rasp and stamping their heels on the floor, the members of this French pop group are to flamenco what Rice-a-Roni is to paella. Which is not to say that some of their international hits, like ''Bamboleo,'' aren't fiendishly catchy. At 8 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888)466-5722; $31.50 to $81.50. (Pareles)    * JOSÉ GONZÁLEZ, JUANA MOLINA, PSAPP (Monday) Connoisseurs of hip television soundtracks might recognize some of the music on this bill. José González, an Argentinean Swede, plays haunting, austere confessions with precision guitar picking and a deadpan hush; his song ''Crosses'' was played in the soap-opera season finale of ''The OC'' this spring. Juana Molina is another whispery Argentine, whose gentle, swirling lullabies draw a listener directly into her reveries. The English duo Psapp places soft vocals over beats constructed from found sounds like splashing water, creaking floorboards and even squeaking cats, creating a kind of hyperintimate electronica; ''Grey's Anatomy'' uses one of Psapp's songs as its theme. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $20. (Sisario)    JOE JACKSON (Tonight) In songs like ''Is She Really Going Out With Him?'' and ''Steppin' Out'' in the late 1970's and early 80's, Joe Jackson made his reputation as a cold-eyed master of British soul, bringing a cutting new-wave minimalism to stories of lonely lovers who cry that they are ''so tired of all the darkness in our lives.'' Since then he has proved remarkably versatile, releasing, among other projects, settings of the Seven Deadly Sins and a Grammy-winning recording of his Symphony No. 1. At 8, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; sold out. (Sisario)    * SALIF KEITA (Tonight) Salif Keita, from Mali, has long been celebrated for a cosmopolitan ear and a voice that can melt hearts, but lately, with a devotion to acoustic guitars, his work has been even more entrancing than usual. His new album, ''M'Bemba'' (Decca), has songs of love and tribute to ancestors, its guitars joined by instruments from Hawaii, the Caribbean and even medieval Europe. At 8, Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305; $39 and $49. (Sisario)    ANGÉLIQUE KIDJO, VUSI MAHLASELA (Tomorrow) Angélique Kidjo, from Benin, has a raw, gutsy voice, charisma that lights up a stage, and the determination to reach the world. Vusi Mahlasela was one of the most important songwriters of the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, not just for his political courage but also for his sterling voice and for three-chord rockers that make earnest sentiments bounce. At 7 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882; $3 suggested donation. (Pareles)    BAABA MAAL (Sunday) Baaba Maal, one of the great singers and bandleaders from Senegal, merges the incantatory vocals and twinkling guitar lines of griot songs with elements of rock, reggae and Afro-Cuban music. His fusions embrace the world without leaving Senegal behind. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $34 in advance, $38 at the door. (Pareles)    * MADONNA (Sunday and Monday) Part 10 (or so), in which our heroine strikes such poses as Jesus on the cross, James Brown in his cape and John Travolta in his white disco suit, all while performing dance-floor hits in new remixes and reconfigurations. Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $64.50 to $354.50 . (Sisario)    MATES OF STATE (Thursday) Most of the time Kori Gardner and Jason Hammel, the married couple who make up Mates of State, sing insistent, almost nagging chants propelled by quick-pulse organ and drums; their latest, ''Bring It Back'' (Barsuk), also has some soothing, affectionate piano songs. At 7 p.m., Castle Clinton National Monument, Battery Park, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789. Free; tickets available at 5 p.m., two per person. (Sisario)    MIDSUMMER NIGHT SWING (Tonight through Thursday) Lincoln Center's annual outdoor series of low-dipping, high-kicking music and dancing continues tonight with western swing by the Bob Wills's Texas Playboys (who have continued since Wills's death 21 years ago); tomorrow features salsa with Alex Torres y Su Orquesta, a 13-piece band; on Tuesday, Jo Thompson sings swing favorites with the J. C. Heard Orchestra; Beth Mead's Big Bandjo, on Wednesday, plays -- can you guess? -- classic swing songs in banjo-led arrangements; and Thursday features plena, the traditional Puerto Rican form of singing, dancing and social commentary, with Plena Libre. At 7:30 p.m., with dance lessons at 6:30 p.m., Josie Robertson Plaza, Columbus Avenue at 63rd Street, (212) 875-5460; $15 each night. (Sisario)    AMY RIGBY, ROBBIE FULKS (Tonight) After years in various New York country-rock groups, Amy Rigby emerged on her own. She has made six worthy albums of succinct, tuneful songs about struggling through adulthood, when jobs, romance and motherhood aren't exactly what she'd hoped for. Robbie Fulks is fond of honky-tonk and the Beatles, and he comes up with tuneful, neatly phrased songs about near-psychotic characters. At 7 p.m., South Street Seaport, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789; free. (Pareles)    * TV ON THE RADIO, MATT POND PA (Tonight) One of Brooklyn's finest and most consistently intriguing bands, TV on the Radio casts a dark and seductive spell with swirling electronics, washes of Pixies-esque guitar and, most alluringly, vocals that draw from both early Peter Gabriel and doo-wop. The band has a fantastic and long-awaited new album, ''Return to Cookie Mountain,'' which is due to be released by Interscope Records later this year. Matt Pond PA adds some interesting colors to its indie-rock songs with touches of cello and strings. At 6:30, Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882; $3 suggested donation. (Sisario)    RHONDA VINCENT (Wednesday) Rhonda Vincent sings, plays mandolin and pushes bluegrass in some modern directions without forgetting standards like ''Muleskinner Blues.'' At 7 p.m., Madison Square Park, Madison Avenue and 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 538-6667; free. (Pareles)    WALKMEN (Tonight) The Walkmen emerged five years ago, playing exquisitely articulated songs of exhaustion and disaffection, with Hamilton Leithauser's weary whine surrounded by an echoey wash of guitar and keyboards. The band's new album, ''A Hundred Miles Off'' (Record Collection), begins intriguingly, with festive Mexican horns, but pretty soon it's back to the familiar guitar-bleached anguish. At 8, Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $17.50. (Sisario)    GARY WILSON AND THE BLIND DATES (Wednesday) The point is often made that not all the bands at CBGB in the late 1970's sounded like the Ramones. But perhaps no one was less like the Ramones than Gary Wilson, who played a kind of shattered lounge music with angst-ridden, unhinged vocals. (He also sometimes wrapped his face in plastic and wore two sets of sunglasses, something that might have actually looked cool on Joey Ramone.) Mr. Wilson disappeared from the scene in the early 80's but has played occasional dates since his re-emergence four years ago. At 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $10. (Sisario)    Cabaret    Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package.(Stephen Holden)    * Eartha Kitt (Tonight and tomorrow night) The latest edition of an act Ms. Kitt has been performing for decades is the lightest, swiftest and funniest one to date, and that's all to the good. More than ever, the singer, now a glamorous 79, pauses to poke fun at her status as the greatest and wittiest of all singing tigresses. At 8:45 and 10:45, Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $100. (Holden)    * JESSICA MOLASKEY (Tonight and tomorrow night) A theater singer with jazz chops, Ms. Molaskey combines sophisticated wit, fierce intelligence and a lightly swinging voice that hovers on the keen edge between happy and sad. A hybrid of the bossa nova standard ''Desafinado'' and Billy Joel's ''Summer, Highland Falls'' performed Brazilian style is the pinnacle of a show whose material she describes as ''limbo songs.'' At 9 and 11:30, the Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $50 cover; $60 prix fixe dinner required at the 9 p.m. shows; $20 minimum at the late shows.

(Nate Chinen)    CYRUS CHESTNUT TRIO (Wednesday through July 8) Mr. Chestnut is a stalwart straight-ahead pianist with a penchant for gospel and blues shadings. He is most comfortable with a trio; this one includes Michael Hawkins on bass and Neil Smith on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25; $30 next Friday and July 8. (Chinen)    THE CLARINETS (Tomorrow) Three clarinetists walk into a bar and manage to make music that's not only serious but also mysterious and broadly textured. The clarinetists are Anthony Burr, Oscar Noriega and Chris Speed, and their improvisational chemistry is no joke. At 7 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)    GEORGE COLLIGAN AND MAD SCIENCE (Tomorrow) Last year Mr. Colligan, a keyboardist with a powerful rhythmic presence, released a modernistic organ trio album called ''Realization'' (Sirocco Music).

The name is an oblique reference to Mr. Pettiford; both Mr. Friedlander's arms are fine. At 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)    BEN GERSTEIN COLLECTIVE (Sunday) Mr. Gerstein, a trombonist, has led this free-improvising ensemble for the last half-dozen years, enlisting bright young players like Jacob Sacks (on keyboards), Eivind Opsvik (on bass) and Jacob Garchik (on accordion and electronics). At 8 and 10 p.m., Bar 4, 444 Seventh Avenue, at 15th Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 832-9800, www.bar4.net; cover, $5. (Chinen)    CURTIS HASSELBRING'S NEW MELLOW EDWARDS/JOHN HOLLENBECK'S CLAUDIA QUINTET (Sunday) Two smart ensembles that harness the forward thrust of rock in the service of an almost chamberlike group cohesiveness. The trombonist Curtis Hasselbring's group is the more raucous of the two; the Claudia Quintet, led by the drummer John Hollenbeck, is the more refined. At 10 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10.

At 8:30 p.m., Night and Day, 230 Fifth Avenue, at President Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 399-2161; cover, $5, with a one-drink minimum.

(Chinen)    * PAUL MOTIAN BAND (Through Sunday) This luminous ensemble consists of two contrasting pairs of improvisers (the tenor saxophonists Mark Turner and Chris Cheek, and the guitarists Steve Cardenas and Ben Monder); a couple of stabilizers (Jacob Bro and Jerome Harris, also guitarists); a lone anchor (the bassist Ben Street); and a mastermind (Mr. Motian, on drums). The band's last ECM album was excellent; its last Village Vanguard appearance, in January, was even better. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $25 tonight and tomorrow, $20 on Sunday, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    RALPH PETERSON SEXTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) As a drummer, Mr. Peterson is a steamroller; as a bandleader, he's more like a sergeant. He has a way of producing strong results, as he probably will with this ensemble, featuring the trumpeter Igmar Thomas, the saxophonists Tia Fuller and Donald Lee, and the brotherly team of Zaccai and Luques Curtis on piano and bass. At 8, 10 and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum.

(Chinen)    KEVIN UEHLINGER QUARTET (Wednesday) Biochemistry and the I Ching are hardly common themes in jazz, but Mr. Uehlinger, a keyboardist, has used aspects of both in his compositional framework. He has also employed musicians independent enough to strain against those constrictions: the trumpeter Nate Wooley, the bassist Keith Witty and the drummer Tyshawn Sorey.

The opening faculty recital, on Wednesday, includes sets by the inventive Benjamin Verdery and the Newman and Oltman Guitar Duo. On Thursday David Leisner and Dennis Koster share the bill. At 8 p.m., Mannes College, 150 West 85th Street, Manhattan, (212) 580-0210, Ext. 4883; $15.

At 8, Ellen Battell Stoeckel Estate, Routes 44 and 272, Norfolk, Conn., (860) 542-3000. (Holland)    TANGLEWOOD  (Tonight) This festival offers the venerable Juilliard String Quartet at Ozawa Hall. The music is by Schubert Alejandro Viñao and Brahms. At 8:30, Lenox, Mass., (888) 266-1200; $16 to $49. (Holland)    Dance    Full reviews of recent performances: nytimes.com/dance.    * AMERICAN BALLET THEATER (Tonight and tomorrow; Monday, Wednesday and Thursday) The last three performances of Kevin McKenzie's ''Swan Lake'' are tonight and tomorrow. On Monday begins a mere four-performance run (the house will be dark on Tuesday) of Frederick Ashton's ''Sylvia,'' which was a critical hit last summer but which Ballet Theater apparently feels cannot sustain a full week's run. Instead, next weekend, there will be three more performances of ''Le Corsaire.'' The ''Sylvia'' is worth seeing, though, both for itself and to provide a contrast to Mark Morris's version, coming next month with the San Francisco Ballet. Ballet Theater's season continues until July 15. Tonight, tomorrow night and Monday, Wednesday and Thursday nights at 8; tomorrow and Wednesday at 2 p.m.; Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000 or abt.org; $23 to $100. (John Rockwell)    * BARD SUMMERSCAPE (Tonight and tomorrow night) This summer arts festival features two new dances by Donna Uchizono, performed by her company and by the guest artist Mikhail Baryshnikov, whose Hell's Kitchen arts center commissioned one piece. Through tomorrow. The festival itself runs through Aug. 20. At 8, Fisher Center, Sosnoff Theater, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845) 758-7900 or summerscape.bard.edu; $25 to $55. (Jennifer Dunning)    CATALYST (Tonight and tomorrow night) This Minneapolis-based dance company, making its New York debut, will perform ''Heat and Life,'' a multimedia dance about global warming by the company director, Emily Johnson. At 7:30 , Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 or dtw.org; $20; $12 for students and 65+. (Dunning)    * CILLA VEE MOVEMENT PROJECTS (Wednesday) The formal gardens, fields and rolling inclines of the Wave Hill environmental center will be ''planted'' with dancers in bright flowing costumes, according to the company director, Claire Elizabeth Barratt, in a performance installation set to violin, flute and vocal music performed live. At 7 p.m. (Garden tour at 6:30 p.m.) Wave Hill, West 249th Street and Independence Avenue, Riverdale, the Bronx, (718) 549-3200 or www.wavehill.org; free with admission to the center: $4; $2 for students and 65+. (Dunning)    LO-LO LO-LO DANCE PERFORMANCE COMPANY (Tonight and tomorrow night) From Japan, the company is making its New York City debut in ''As an Ugly Duck,'' a quintet choreographed by Kazumi Taoka that explores love and force by using bodies, space, eye contact, touching and voice. At 8, Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479; $15; $10 for students. (Dunning)    * JACOB'S PILLOW DANCE FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday; Wednesday and Thursday) The Limón Dance company will be in the larger Ted Shawn Theater through the weekend, followed there on Wednesday and Thursday (and next weekend) by the Suzanne Farrell Ballet from Washington in an all-Balanchine program. In the smaller Doris Duke Studio Theater ASzURe & Artists perform this weekend, with Emanuel Gat Dance from Israel moving in on Thursday, through next weekend. Limón tonight and tomorrow night at 8, and tomorrow and Sunday at 2 p.m.; Farrell Wednesday and Thursday at 8 p.m.; Shawn Theater, $50.

Ten percent off all tickets for students, ages 65+ and children. Details of the week's free performances and exhibitions can be found at jacobspillow.org. Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, 358 George Carter Road, Becket, Mass.; (413) 243-0745. (Rockwell)    * LA MAMA MOVES! (Tonight through Sunday; Thursday) This eclectic whirl of a downtown-dance festival continues at three theaters in the La MaMa complex with ''Mavericks in Motion,'' whose choreographers include Abby Chen, Bhavani Lee and Deborah Lohse (tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and Sunday at 2:30 p.m.); the highly recommended ''Dancing Divas'' program of choreography by Pat Catterson, Ellen Fisher, Keely Garfield, Sally Gross, Deborah Jowitt, Jodi Melnick, Yvonne Meier and Vicky Shick (tonight at 10); ''Children of Ur,'' which includes dances by Karinne Keithley, David Neuman, Nicky Paraiso and the program curator, Chris Yon (tomorrow at 5:30 p.m.); ''Burlesque,'' whose stars include Julie Atlas Muz and Dirty Martini (tomorrow at 10 p.m.); ''Duet,'' with a roster of five pairs of dancer-choreographers (Sunday at 5:30 p.m.); and ''Border Jumping,'' with work by six artists, including Bill Irwin, representing the United States (Thursday at 7:30 p.m.). La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, west of Second Avenue, East Village, (212) 475-7710 or www.lamama.org; $10 (Dunning)    NICHOLAS LEICHTER ( Tomorrow) For its 10th-anniversary season, the company Nicholasleichterdance presents four pieces commissioned by Dance New Amsterdam, which date from 1997 (''Animal'') to 2006 (''Sweetwash Special''). It is an opportunity to see how much both the choreographer and Dance New Amsterday, which was formerly known as Dance Space and now has splendid new digs downtown, have grown. At 8 p.m., Dance New Amsterdam, 280 Broadway, at Chambers Street, TriBeCa, (212) 279-4200 or www.dnadance.org; $20, or $15 for members. (Erika Kinetz)    * NOCHE FLAMENCA WITH SOLEDAD BARRIO (Tonight through Sunday; Thursday) Ms. Barrio is a remarkable dancer, serious and impassioned, and the hit of this winter's Flamenco Gala at City Center. Her Spanish company, founded with her husband, Martin Santangelo, has settled into the intimate Theater 80 for this month and next, through July 30. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 8; tomorrow and Sunday at 2 p.m.; Sunday at 5 p.m.; Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 352-3101 or theatermania.com; $45. (Rockwell)    * PARADIGM and BATTLEWORKS (Wednesday and Thursday) In their shared week at the Joyce, these two companies bring together some of the best names in modern dance, both old and new. Paradigm will perform works by Carmen deLavallade, Gus Solomons Jr., Wally Cardona, Larry Keigwin and Kay Cummings. Robert Battle's gifted young ensemble will perform ''Primate,'' a world premiere set to music by Philip Hamilton; ''Communion,'' a New York premiere; ''Takademe''; ''Two''; and ''Promenade.'' (Through July 9.) Opening night, Wednesday, is a shared program; Battleworks performs alone on Thursday. Both are at 8 p.m. The Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $30. (Kinetz)    Art    Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.         Museums    * American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith)    * BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and castoff clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to and settlement in the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,'  through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedekers, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Michael Kimmelman)    COOPER HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'YINKA SHONIBARE SELECTS: WORKS FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through Sept. 24. A British sculptor of Nigerian descent organizes an absorbing small exhibition of objects related to travel from the Cooper Hewitt collection, and adds his own oblique comment on 19th-century imperialism in the form of two headless female mannequins in Victorian-style dresses cut from African-patterned fabrics, poised on six-foot stilts strapped to their feet. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Ken Johnson)    * Frick Collection : 'Jean-Étienne Liotard (1702-1789): Swiss MasteR,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including the young Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Holland Cotter)    * FRICK COLLECTION: 'VERONESE'S ALLEGORIES: VIRTUE, LOVE AND EXPLORATION IN RENAISSANCE VENICE,' through July 16. Paolo Veronese (1528-88), a superb colorist and one of the most suavely sensuous of Renaissance Venetian painters, used the age-old device of allegory to make abstract concepts visual, often by means of human or mythological figures. In this five-painting show, the first to include all of his large-scale allegories from American collections, high ideals mingle with earthy and sometimes erotic physicality, as in the painting ''Venus and Mars United by Love.'' (See above.) (Glueck)    SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestos and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)    * International Center of Photography: 'UNKNOWN WEEGEE,' through Aug. 27. From the 1930's through the 50's, Weegee -- real name, Arthur Fellig (1899-1968) -- was one of the best known news photographers in the country. He specialized in capturing the sensational side of urban life: crime, disaster, demimonde nightlife. Tirelessly invasive, he lived by night. For him, the city was a 24-hour emergency room, an amphetamine drip. This show of 95 pictures gives a good sense of his range and calls particular attention to his awareness of social problems related to class and race. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter)    JEWISH MUSEUM: 'EVA HESSE: SCULPTURE,' through Sept. 17. Assembled by Elizabeth Sussman, curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Fred Wasserman, a curator at the Jewish Museum, this show focuses on a pivotal Hesse exhibition, ''Chain Polymers,'' at the Fischbach Gallery -- known for promoting Minimalist painters -- in 1968. Arguably a compilation of her best work, it was her first and only solo show of sculpture during her lifetime, and most of the objects in it -- along with some earlier and later pieces -- are here. One of the earliest is ''Compart'' (1966), a four-panel vertical that starts at the top with a fully formed, round, breastlike image of neatly wound cord that mysteriously breaks up into part of the same image on each of the three panels beneath. The last, most startling and most impressive work is ''Untitled (Rope Piece),'' of 1970, made as Ms. Hesse was dying, finished with the help of friends. (An exhibition of her drawings is on view at the Drawing Center.) 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck)    * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ANGLOMANIA: TRADITION AND TRANSGRESSION IN BRITISH FASHION,' through Sept. 4. Ranging from early-18th-century gowns to next season's evening wear, this show crowds 65 extravagantly clad mannequins into the Met's normally serene English period rooms, trying to connect the sartorial innovations of the English dandy, the aggressive tribal attire of punk and the deconstructive impulses of today's British fashion stars. A certain confusion, both intellectual and visual, reigns, but there is more than enough to look at. (212) 535-7710. (Smith)    * met: 'GIRODET: ROMANTIC REBEL,' through Aug. 27. Hugely famous in the early 19th century, Girodet dropped down the memory chute. His ''Ossian Receiving the Ghosts of French Heroes,'' painted for Napoleon, is one of the most deranged pictures in art history. It's so unhinged that it's almost lovable, which is otherwise the last word to come to mind for an artist who, in his uptight, smarty-pants mode, could be a bore. But give the show a shot. It's sometimes brilliant, and Girodet's strangeness and fairly repellent character make him at least fascinating to contemplate and heroic in his immoderation. (212) 535-7710. (Kimmelman)    * Met: 'Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings,' through Sept. 10. ''Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings'' gets a huge gold A for truth in advertising. The treasures are plentiful, rare and splendid. A carved wood figure of kneeling shaman, arms extended, time-raked face entranced, is simply one of the greatest sculptures in the museum. And wait till you see the painted ceramic vessel known as the ''Dazzler Vase,'' with its red and green patterns like jade on fire, you'll understand its name. Much of the work has never traveled before; many objects have only recently come to light in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. They add up to an exhibition as a think-piece essay on how a culture saw itself in the world. (212) 535-7710. (Cotter)    MET: 'HATSHEPSUT,' through July 9. Can a queen be a king, too? Consider the case of Hatshepsut, an Egyptian ruler of the 15th century B.C. She assumed the supreme title of pharaoh and ruled Egypt in that powerfully masculine role until her death. Hatshepsut is the subject of a celebratory show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Met's department of Egyptian art. Organized by the Met and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, it includes many objects from the Met's own extensive holdings, excavated at its digs in the 1920's and 30's. But it isn't so easy to follow Hatshepsut's trail in this ambitious show, what with the number of relatives, subordinates, minor officials and such who also have a place in it, along with scarabs, jewelry, pottery, furniture and other artifacts. (212) 535-7710. (Glueck)    Met: KARA WALKER AT THE MET: 'AFTER THE DELUGE,' through July 30. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's first foray into artist-organized shows is a small tour de force of curatorial creativity. Inspired partly by Hurricane Katrina, Ms. Walker has combined works from the Met with examples of her own art, connecting shared themes of race, poverty and water to illuminate contemporary art's inevitable dialogue with past art. The show has as many crosscurrents and undertows as a river. One of the most interesting concerns the genteel technique of cut-paper silhouette that is the basis of Ms. Walker's scathing take-no-prisoners exploration of slavery and its tragic legacy. (212) 535-7710. (Smith)    * Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,'  through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontës to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or www.themorgan.org. (Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.) (Cotter)    Museum of Arts AND Design: 'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN,' through Sept. 3 Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and useable. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535. (Smith)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DADA,' through Sept. 11. This is pretty much Dada's official survey (an oxymoron), and it makes nearly all 450 or so objects in it look elegant. That hat rack looks awfully stylish now. It's good to be reacquainted with a generation of artists who had no market to speak of and for whom society's corruption and exhaustion seemed golden opportunities to make themselves useful. Cynical and traumatized, the Dadaists were tireless young optimists at heart. They discovered a world full of wonders, and we are, on the whole, their beneficiaries. (212) 708-9400. (Kimmelman)    Museum of Modern Art: Douglas Gordon: 'Timeline,' through Sept 4. This selection of works by the artist known for appropriating and inventively manipulating Hollywood movies includes his projection of Alfred Hitchcock's ''Psycho,'' which runs so slowly that it takes 24 hours to complete, and a large-scale video installation that studies a circus elephant performing in an empty art gallery. Museum of Modern Art. (212) 708-9400. (Johnson)    * New-York Historical Society: Legacies: Contemporary Artists Reflect on Slavery, through January. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second in a trio of exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society. 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400. (Cotter)    New York Public Library: 'FRENCH BOOK ART/LIVRES D'ARTISTES: ARTISTS AND POETS IN DIALOGUE,' through Aug. 19. Organized with the Bibliothèque Littéraire Jacques Doucet in Paris, this lavish exhibition surveys some of the experimental ferment brought on by the combination of free verse, visionary publishers and the high rate of talent among French artists and poets, especially in the early years of the 20th century. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089. (Smith)    NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Glueck)    Galleries: Uptown    * WANGECHI MUTU: EXHUMING GLUTTONY: A LOVER'S REQUIEM In tandem with this artist's Chelsea debut, an over-the-top installation made with the British architect David Adjaye includes fur-trimmed wine bottles dripping wine, animal skins and an enormous raw wood table. Conflating morgue, tannery and banquet hall, it brings the excess and color of paintings on Mylar into real space, but its main message seems to be: I built this because I can. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646) 672-9212, through July 28. (Smith)    * Sarah Sze: 'Corner Plot' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)    Galleries: 57th Street    Eva Lundsager: 'Wherever' Improvising with infectiously playful freedom on medium-large canvases, Ms. Lundsager creates hedonistic and trippy abstract landscapes composed of dots, squiggles, woozy stripes, smudgy areas, luminous open spaces, and colors ranging from neon bright to muddy brown. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212) 445-0444, through next Friday. (Johnson)    * Rudy Burckhardt: 'New York Paintings' Known as a photographer and filmmaker, Burckhardt (1914-1999) also painted all through his career. His Manhattan cityscapes, mostly rooftop views of other buildings, have a fresh, almost naïve immediacy and a sophisticated way with relations between surface and depth and complexity and simplicity. Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050, through July 28. (Johnson)    Galleries: SoHo    Philippe Decrauzat: 'Plate 28' A conceptually perplexing but visually striking installation by this young Swiss artist includes a black and white grid painted on the walls; a sculpture based on a Russian Constructivist design; and a grainy, flickering black-and-white film showing glimpses of ominous landscapes from ''The Twilight Zone.'' Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, at Broome Street, (212) 925-2035, through July 15. (Johnson)    EVA HESSE: 'DRAWING'  This show deals in depth with Ms. Hesse's works on paper, ranging from rough sketches or notes, to test pieces made from various materials that function as drawings, to finished projects that stand on their own. A zealous researcher, Ms. Hesse made all kinds of thumbnail notations and calculations to explore the properties of her malleable materials. Many of these sheets, perhaps too many, are shown, too. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, through July 15. (Glueck)    Galleries: Chelsea    'Nightmares of Summer' This entertaining selection of dark, weird and nasty visions includes Marilyn Minter's big photograph of dirty feet with toenails painted fashionably green; Barnaby Furnas's explosive, cartoonish painting of a woman at the beach spilling blood-red wine; an otherworldly coppery seascape by Stuart Elster; photographs by Anders Petersen, Hans Bellmer and Diane Arbus; drawings by Carroll Dunham and Steve DiBenedetto; and more. Marvelli, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 627-3363, through July 8. (Johnson)    'Scarecrow' The work in this show is supposed to be menacing and abrasive, but it is mostly interesting and amusing. Highlights include David Herbert's giant, handmade replica of a ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' videocassette; Rashid Johnson's life-size, photographic nude self-portrait; David Kennedy Cutler's model of the White House made of chewing gum and imbedded in dirt; and a short Matthew Barney-like film by Chris Larson. Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, (212) 727-3323, through July 8. (Johnson)    Martin Schoeller: 'Close Up' Extraordinarily large and detailed mug-shot-like portraits of celebrities like Jack Nicholson, Angelina Jolie and Bill Clinton. Hasted Hunt, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-0006, through Sept. 1. (Johnson)    * Stephen Shore The postcard-size color pictures of diners, restaurant meals, hotel rooms, roadside signs, ordinary people and other nondescript subjects taken by this eminent photographer on cross-country road trips in the early 1970's are enthralling, beautiful, nostalgic and romantic. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-1121, through July 7. (Johnson)    RICHARD SERRA: 'ROLLED AND FORGED' The centerpiece of the latest Serra spectacular, which favors mass, compression and rectangles over stretched-thin curves and spirals, is a low-lying maze in which the shifting heights and staggered placement of 16 thick, hedgelike plates create one of the most spatially complex yet straightforward works of his career. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111, through Aug. 11. (Smith)    Last Chance    Jackie Gendel: 'Portraits' With seemingly offhand painterly verve, smudgy colors and a sweet sense of humor, Ms. Gendel creates smart and sensuous, semi-abstract riffs on Modernist portraiture. Jeff Bailey, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 989-0156; closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    * NEW VIDEO, NEW EUROPE A selection of 49 tapes by 40 artists from 16 Eastern European countries, several of which did not exist before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, presents bits and pieces of another world. Revolution, landmines, economic hardship and disappearing ways of life alternate with wit and artistic originality. The whole forms an inadvertent documentary, but many of the parts are well worth attention. The Kitchen, 512 East 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793; closing today. (Smith)    * The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art: abstraction. This show is stylishly installed. (One gallery bursts with color, another has a cool, platinum shimmer.) The 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500; closing Sunday.
