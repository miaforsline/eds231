1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"There's a pandemic sweeping across the globe. No, not COVID, a different one. For decades, a brutal fungal infection has been decimating amphibians worldwide."
1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"""We call it a panzootic,"" said Andrea Adams, an assistant researcher in the Earth Research Institute at UC Santa Barbara. ""It's like a pandemic, only with animals."" "
1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"Scientists are hard at work investigating the disease's origin, trajectory, genetics and impact in an effort to safeguard vulnerable and valuable biodiversity. Biologists from Southern and Baja California have published the first major account and most comprehensive study of the amphibian disease chytridiomycosis in the Mediterranean region of Baja California. "
1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"Their results, which appear in Global Ecology and Conservation, indicate the disease is more prevalent on the peninsula than in similar areas of Southern California. "
1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"""Contrary to what we had expected, what's going on in Baja California is very different than what's going on with chytrid fungus in Southern California, where the species are pretty much the same, and the environment is very similar,"" said Adams, the lead author. "
1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"Chytrids form a large group of mostly soil-dwelling fungi. They're quite common, and generally pose no harm. However, two species have evolved to infect the skin of amphibians. In highly infected animals, the skin responds by thickening. "
1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"This has a downside. ""You probably heard frogs drink through their skin,"" Adams said. It's true. They also exchange salts and minerals through their skin. So when their skin thickens, it can be a death sentence for many individuals. "
1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"The team wanted to know what environmental and biological factors influence chytrid infection in Baja California, particularly at different elevations. Unfortunately, there has been little research on the topic in the Mediterranean region of Baja California. "
1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"""We knew chytrid was here, but we didn't know how it was affecting different species or which variables mattered most,"" said co-author Anny Peralta-García, director of Conservación de Fauna del Noroeste, a nonprofit organization dedicated to research and conservation in Baja California, especially for less charismatic species. "
1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"Along with UCSB professor Cherie Briggs, Adams teamed up with Peralta-García's group and Carlos A. Flores-López, a researcher at the Autonomous University of Baja California, to carry out a survey of the disease in local frogs. "
1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"The scientists collected samples quarterly from November 2015 to October 2016. They visited three sites in Baja California, each at a different elevation. The lowest is a perennial stream about 12 miles south of Ensenada. The area's hot springs make it a popular recreational spot. "
1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"The middlemost location is about 2,000 feet up in the foothills of the Sierra San Pedro Mártir, a mountain range in northern Baja California. "
1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"Lastly, the team surveyed a mountain meadow 6,700 feet high in Sierra de San Pedro Mártir National Park, where despite some impacts from livestock, native amphibians still appear to thrive. "
1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"The Mexican team spent two to three days per location catching animals at night. They swabbed the frogs' skin to collect samples of the fungus, then released them back into the wild. Altogether, they collected enough data to analyze the disease prevalence and load in four species, including the endangered California red-legged frog and the invasive American bullfrog. "
1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"""We found that when it comes to chytrid infection, the most important things are where you live and who you are,"" Adams said. In other words, elevation and species. Chytrid infections were more common and more intense at higher elevations, where the cooler, moister environment provides ideal conditions for the fungus. "
1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"Some species are also more susceptible to the infection than others. For instance, the California red-legged frog was among the most infected, with the highest observed infection intensity and prevalence compared to other species. "
1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"The team found that chytrid was much more prevalent in Baja California, where 68% of animals they surveyed had the fungus, compared to 15% in Southern California, as observed in a previous study. "
1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"The difference was particularly striking for California red-legged frogs. In another study in Southern California, only 30% of the species was infected. ""In Baja California, we found that 99% of the California red-legged frogs at the highest-elevation site were infected,"" Adams said. "
1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"Not only was the disease more prevalent, infected animals also carried a higher pathogen load in Baja California. The team was curious when the fungus first arrived in Baja California. If it appeared recently, that could help explain the high infection intensities compared with Southern California. "
1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"""When the fungus first arrives to a place it can cause die-offs and declines in susceptible species,"" Adams said. "
1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"Fortunately, the San Diego Natural History Museum has a wealth of amphibian specimens from Baja California that the team used to investigate the history of chytrid's arrival. The scientists found the fungus in specimens collected as early as 1932. Previous research found the earliest record of chytrid detection from Baja California is 1926. "
1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"For comparison, the first record of the fungus in Southern California was found in specimens from Los Angeles County in 1915. This makes some sense, as invasive species often arrive at ports of entry and then fan out into the landscape. The combined ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are the largest on the West Coast. "
1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"So, if chytrid has been in both places Baja California and Southern California for about the same amount of time, what could explain the differences the team found? "
1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"Much like the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the chytrid fungus has evolved over time. As the fungus mutates and adapts, more virulent or infectious strains may emerge in different locations. "
1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"Understanding what's going on will require long-term monitoring, tracking individuals over time and establishing baselines. ""These data help us prioritize sites that need conservation actions,"" Peralta-García said. ""For example, La Grulla, our highest elevation site, needs to continue to be monitored for disease."" "
1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"The group is continuing their sampling and rehabilitation work, though getting samples tested will require more funding. "
1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"""Right now, our main focus is trying to increase populations of California red-legged frogs in Baja California and Southern California,"" Peralta-García said. "
1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"They've had success reintroducing eggs, which lack keratin, so are not susceptible to the fungus, to historical sites in California. This means eggs can't transfer the fungus from one site to another. "
1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"Adams does similar work in the United States. ""Anny and I are actually doing very similar things,"" she said. ""We are both working to find the best ways to bring these frogs back to places they've disappeared from, and we learn a lot from each other."" "
1,2022-04-05,IPCC says it's not too late to avoid climate catastrophe,"Chytrid is always part of the discussion, she added. ""We can still be moving forward on chytrid questions and chytrid monitoring, while also trying to remedy species declines."""

2,2022-04-08,IPCC Adaptation Report: It's Later Than You Think,"The amphibian has been found in five different locations in Co Offaly, Co Tipperary and Co Down."
2,2022-04-08,IPCC Adaptation Report: It's Later Than You Think,"The alpine newt has the potential to have a detrimental impact on local biodiversity by acting as competition to native species, and by transmitting a disease called chytrid to native amphibian species such as the common frog, smooth newt and natterjack toad."
2,2022-04-08,IPCC Adaptation Report: It's Later Than You Think,Chytrid has driven many species of frogs to extinction in the tropics.
2,2022-04-08,IPCC Adaptation Report: It's Later Than You Think,"Zoologist Éinne Ó Cathasaigh, who works with the Herpetological Society of Ireland (HSI), said the alpine newt was most likely introduced here through the pet trade by someone keen to add colour to their garden pond. With gold irises and black pupils, it is one of the most striking species among European newts."
2,2022-04-08,IPCC Adaptation Report: It's Later Than You Think,"On the HSI's discovery, he added: ""We found them in a disused swimming pool. There were hundreds of them. In Offaly, we've already recorded around 30 this year. They are highly resilient to environmental conditions here and they reproduce very, very quickly."""
2,2022-04-08,IPCC Adaptation Report: It's Later Than You Think,"Describing the potential threat posed to the local environment if alpine newts harm local amphibians, he said: ""Frogs, for example, are a keystone species. They have a huge impact on our environment. They eat so many insects that we would be overrun without them."
2,2022-04-08,IPCC Adaptation Report: It's Later Than You Think,"""A huge amount of flies return to stagnant water to breed, and where do frogs also breed? Stagnant water. So they keep the number of flies low."""

2,2022-04-08,IPCC Adaptation Report: It's Later Than You Think,"Mr Ó Cathasaigh said the new discovery should should make people more conscious of invasive species, particularly their local area and gardens."
2,2022-04-08,IPCC Adaptation Report: It's Later Than You Think,"""It is the perfect example of why we need to be a lot more careful of what we introduce. Realistically speaking, when people are building an artificial pond they should leave it, and nature will take care of it. Put a few plants in and amphibians will come,"" he said."

People pay anywhere from $250 for a ceremony in the East Texas woods to $8,500 for a more gilded beachfront setting in Tulum, Mexico, to consume the venom. "
9,2022-04-10,One Last #Climate Warning in New IPCC Report: 'Now or Never' — Inside Climate News #ActOnClimate #KeepItInTheGround,"Toad medicine apostles are now increasingly split between those like Mr. Capone, who support using synthetic versions that are easy to produce, and purists who say they will never stop using venom collected from the toads themselves. As retreat operators tailor experiences for therapeutic, recreational or spiritual purposes, the discussions over threats to the toad are growing more contentious. "

""We would never go with synthetic,"" she added. "
9,2022-04-10,One Last #Climate Warning in New IPCC Report: 'Now or Never' — Inside Climate News #ActOnClimate #KeepItInTheGround,"The toad itself, found primarily in the Sonoran desert, which straddles parts of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico, is already thought to have been extirpated in California, where it hasn't been found in the wild in decades. Authorities in New Mexico list it as threatened, citing excessive collection among factors. "
9,2022-04-10,One Last #Climate Warning in New IPCC Report: 'Now or Never' — Inside Climate News #ActOnClimate #KeepItInTheGround,"The Sonoran desert toad can still be found in parts of Arizona and Sonora in northwest Mexico. One of the largest toads native to North America and remarkably long-lived with a life span reaching 20 years, it hibernates underground for most of the year, resurfacing to breed around the summer monsoon rains. "
9,2022-04-10,One Last #Climate Warning in New IPCC Report: 'Now or Never' — Inside Climate News #ActOnClimate #KeepItInTheGround,"Herpetologists say the toad seems to have adapted to human-modified landscapes like irrigation ditches, suburban yards and water tanks on cattle ranches. "
9,2022-04-10,One Last #Climate Warning in New IPCC Report: 'Now or Never' — Inside Climate News #ActOnClimate #KeepItInTheGround,"But risks abound. Motorists already kill many of the toads, and predators such as raccoons also target them. "
9,2022-04-10,One Last #Climate Warning in New IPCC Report: 'Now or Never' — Inside Climate News #ActOnClimate #KeepItInTheGround,"When the toad is threatened, it excretes toxins strong enough to kill full-grown dogs. A substance found in these toxins, 5-MeO-DMT, can be dried into crystals and smoked in a pipe, producing an intense experience generally lasting 15 to 30 minutes, in contrast to other psychedelic substances that can involve hours of hallucinating and vomiting. "
9,2022-04-10,One Last #Climate Warning in New IPCC Report: 'Now or Never' — Inside Climate News #ActOnClimate #KeepItInTheGround,"Five-MeO-DMT remains effectively illegal in the United States, where it is classified as a Schedule 1 substance. But while many users opt to attend retreats in Mexico, where it is legal, ceremonies are also taking place in the United States, where law enforcement agencies are largely tolerating its growing popularity. "
9,2022-04-10,One Last #Climate Warning in New IPCC Report: 'Now or Never' — Inside Climate News #ActOnClimate #KeepItInTheGround,"Celebrities from Chelsea Handler to Joe Rogan have smoked the venom, commonly called Five or Bufo (after the toad's former scientific name, Bufo alvarius; it's been renamed Incilius alvarius).

9,2022-04-10,One Last #Climate Warning in New IPCC Report: 'Now or Never' — Inside Climate News #ActOnClimate #KeepItInTheGround,"Still, the surging demand for the Sonoran desert toad's venom is raising alarm. Robert Villa, president of the Tucson Herpetological Society, compared the threats with those faced by Asian river turtles, which are facing extinction risks because of habitat loss and a belief that they cure ailments like cancer. "

"
9,2022-04-10,One Last #Climate Warning in New IPCC Report: 'Now or Never' — Inside Climate News #ActOnClimate #KeepItInTheGround,"Some warn that collecting the venom also places stress on the toad, a process often described as ""milking,"" in which a person strokes the amphibian under its chin to initiate a defensive response. The toad then releases a milky substance that can be scraped, dried and smoked. "
9,2022-04-10,One Last #Climate Warning in New IPCC Report: 'Now or Never' — Inside Climate News #ActOnClimate #KeepItInTheGround,"Seeking to meet demand, some proponents have started breeding farms with hundreds or even thousands of toads. But Mr. Villa also warned that such sites could become vectors for outbreaks of chytrid fungus, a pathogen that can devastate amphibians. Predators could also target such locations, he said, as coyotes and Gila monsters have done in California in places where desert tortoises are raised. Reports of poaching are also worrying toad advocates. "
9,2022-04-10,One Last #Climate Warning in New IPCC Report: 'Now or Never' — Inside Climate News #ActOnClimate #KeepItInTheGround,"In the meantime, a growing number of herpetologists and researchers of psychedelic drugs are citing studies that show the synthetic form, which is relatively easy to produce, has helped ease symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress.

9,2022-04-10,One Last #Climate Warning in New IPCC Report: 'Now or Never' — Inside Climate News #ActOnClimate #KeepItInTheGround,"Still, some of the most influential figures in the Bufo scene have promoted Indigenous connections. Dr. Octavio Rettig, a physician from Guadalajara, Mexico, said he introduced the venom to the Seri people in northwestern Mexico in 2011 in a bid to combat crystal meth addiction. "

9,2022-04-10,One Last #Climate Warning in New IPCC Report: 'Now or Never' — Inside Climate News #ActOnClimate #KeepItInTheGround,"Bufo retreats are now available in the Seri community at which the actual venom of the toad is consumed. At the same time, others pushing for protections for the toad have argued that the promotion of Indigenous connections could have disastrous effects by further depleting toad populations. "
9,2022-04-10,One Last #Climate Warning in New IPCC Report: 'Now or Never' — Inside Climate News #ActOnClimate #KeepItInTheGround,"""People hunger for the narrative that the toad was used ancestrally by the Indigenous people of Sonora,"" said Ana Maria Ortiz, a doctoral student who is carrying out a population study of the toad at the University of Wisconsin's School of Human Ecology.

9,2022-04-10,One Last #Climate Warning in New IPCC Report: 'Now or Never' — Inside Climate News #ActOnClimate #KeepItInTheGround,"Ms. Ortiz, who has used Bufo to help people overcome addictions, said she was aware that some users skeptical of the synthetic form describe an ""entourage effect"" involving other compounds in the toad's natural secretions.

9,2022-04-10,One Last #Climate Warning in New IPCC Report: 'Now or Never' — Inside Climate News #ActOnClimate #KeepItInTheGround,"Dr. Gerardo Sandoval, another Mexican physician involved in introducing Bufo to new practitioners, likened the synthetic version to ""watching a black-and-white movie.""

Participants in a Facebook group have highlighted claims of psychological manipulation and rape against Dr. Sandoval; he has disputed them. Dr. Rettig has come under criticism over the deaths of people who have taken part in Bufo ceremonies. 
9,2022-04-10,One Last #Climate Warning in New IPCC Report: 'Now or Never' — Inside Climate News #ActOnClimate #KeepItInTheGround,"Dr. Rettig acknowledged that deaths had occurred but pointed to other pre-existing health problems, like heart conditions. "

Dr. Octavio Rettig, a physician from Guadalajara, Mexico, said he introduced the substance to the Seri people in northwestern Mexico in 2011 in a bid to combat crystal meth addiction."
11,2022-04-04,Saudi Arabia dilutes fossil fuel phase out language with techno fixes in IPCC report," ''After they got the medicine, they started to put the puzzle together,'' said Dr. Rettig, 43, citing what he believes was a rescue of the Seri's ''lost traditions.'' ''They recognized the benefits of the toad medicine.''"
11,2022-04-04,Saudi Arabia dilutes fossil fuel phase out language with techno fixes in IPCC report," Bufo retreats are now available in the Seri community at which the actual secretion of the toad is consumed. At the same time, others pushing for protections for the toad have argued that the promotion of Indigenous connections could have disastrous effects by further depleting toad populations."
11,2022-04-04,Saudi Arabia dilutes fossil fuel phase out language with techno fixes in IPCC report," ''People hunger for the narrative that the toad was used ancestrally by the Indigenous people of Sonora,'' said Ana Maria Ortiz, a doctoral student who is carrying out a population study of the toad at the University of Wisconsin's School of Human Ecology. ''There's an appeal to that narrative, and even I believed it at the onset.''"
11,2022-04-04,Saudi Arabia dilutes fossil fuel phase out language with techno fixes in IPCC report," Ms. Ortiz, who has used Bufo to help people overcome addictions, said she was aware that some users skeptical of the synthetic form describe an ''entourage effect'' involving other compounds in the toad's natural secretions."
11,2022-04-04,Saudi Arabia dilutes fossil fuel phase out language with techno fixes in IPCC report," ''A lot of the other compounds in the toxins are actually cardiac glycosides that can kill you,'' Ms. Ortiz said. ''Synthetic 5-MeO-DMT is just as good. People need to leave the toads alone.''"
11,2022-04-04,Saudi Arabia dilutes fossil fuel phase out language with techno fixes in IPCC report," Dr. Gerardo Sandoval, another Mexican physician involved in introducing Bufo to new practitioners, likened the synthetic version to ''watching a black-and-white movie.''"
11,2022-04-04,Saudi Arabia dilutes fossil fuel phase out language with techno fixes in IPCC report," ''Toad medicine is watching the movie in 3-D,'' added Dr. Sandoval, who owns a ranch in Sonora, where he raises the toads and charges $500 for a venom ceremony."
11,2022-04-04,Saudi Arabia dilutes fossil fuel phase out language with techno fixes in IPCC report," Still, Dr. Sandoval said that relying on the toad involved risks. In one incident last summer, he said, intruders stole hundreds of adult toads from his ranch."
11,2022-04-04,Saudi Arabia dilutes fossil fuel phase out language with techno fixes in IPCC report, Quarreling around 5-MeO-DMT may just be starting as Bufo pioneers also face claims of abuse. Participants in a Facebook group have highlighted claims of psychological manipulation and rape against Dr. Sandoval; he has disputed them. Dr. Rettig has come under criticism over the deaths of people who have taken part in Bufo ceremonies.
11,2022-04-04,Saudi Arabia dilutes fossil fuel phase out language with techno fixes in IPCC report," Dr. Rettig acknowledged that deaths had occurred but pointed to other pre-existing health problems, like heart conditions."
11,2022-04-04,Saudi Arabia dilutes fossil fuel phase out language with techno fixes in IPCC report," ''I am a physician,'' said Dr. Rettig, who estimated that he had worked with thousands of people taking Bufo. ''Only a madman can expect that no one will suffer any sideways consequence.''"

21,2022-04-06,IPCC report focusses on last-minute strategies to cut emissions,"The Denver Zoo is breeding endangered boreal toads for a population restoration project with the Colorado Parks and Wildlife department. A combination of habitat loss and chytrid fungal infections threaten the native species' survival, and project leaders hope to release approximately 20,000 tadpoles in the state next year. "
21,2022-04-06,IPCC report focusses on last-minute strategies to cut emissions,"When we lose species, ecosystems become dysfunctional and noxious, and invasive species take hold. From cane toads in Florida to disease-transmitting mosquitoes everywhere, invasive species pose a threat to public health, and many become pests that threaten agriculture and food security. Taking steps to prevent further biodiversity loss and stem this extinction of species calls for international government collaboration and science-based responsible planetary stewardship. "
21,2022-04-06,IPCC report focusses on last-minute strategies to cut emissions,"Dear Dr. Fox: Regarding the planetary crises that too few are speaking about and reacting to, I feel like the overwhelming majority of people who do speak out are missing the real problem. It's pretty obvious to me that the biggest issue to be faced is that the planet is being overwhelmed by too many ignorant people. This includes me. "
21,2022-04-06,IPCC report focusses on last-minute strategies to cut emissions,"I don't know how we can rectify the current situation: a constantly increasing population of energy-using, food-eating, tree-clearing, methane-producing humans all just looking for the easiest, most convenient way to get through the day and improve their lifestyle. I'm right there with them! But we desperately need to face the fact that we have outlived our usefulness to the planet. "
21,2022-04-06,IPCC report focusses on last-minute strategies to cut emissions,"This is not new. We have been reducing forest area to grow crops and meat-producing herds, eliminating other animal species, burning trees and emitting methane gases for a long time. We are just now becoming aware of the damage we have been doing damage that will make life much more difficult for our offspring in the decades to come. Perhaps related to all this, my 47-year-old daughter has elected not to have children. I wish I had the answers. E.B., Tulsa, Oklahoma "
21,2022-04-06,IPCC report focusses on last-minute strategies to cut emissions,"Dear E.B.: Your daughter is not alone in deciding not to reproduce. This will have economic consequences in some countries, as China now fears with its declining birth rate. But this is the best decision for the planet, though it is generally opposed for various political, religious and economic reasons. A Pew Research Center survey finds that more people in the U.S. are not having children. Considering the millions of displaced and able-bodied refugees seeking sanctuary in the U.S. and Europe, there should be no significant labor shortages in the future. "
21,2022-04-06,IPCC report focusses on last-minute strategies to cut emissions,"You are not alone in feeling despair facing the clear evidence of climate change and a planet whose metabolism we have accelerated with destructive consequences. Many find some comfort in ""going green"" politically and becoming vegan or vegetarian to reduce their carbon footprint. There is much we can do as consumers and voting citizens to ameliorate, but not reverse, the ecological damage our species has caused worldwide. "

24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: What bill(s) are we against? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"USARK does not oppose HR4521 (America COMPETES Act), S1260 (U.S. Innovation and Competition Act), or the reconciled bill (merger of HR4521 and S1260) that is expected to eventually emerge from a conference committee. We are opposed specifically to the Lacey Act amendments found within HR4521, in Section 71102 (which was added behind closed doors absent from any public process). Our goal is to keep the Lacey Act amendments from being added to the merged bill, or any other bill. "

24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: What does it do? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Briefly: 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"A ban on interstate transportation and importation of every species currently listed as ""injurious"" would be enacted, even for species that could not survive in most of the U.S. (Note: importation is currently banned.) "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"A new ""emergency designation"" would be granted that would allow species to be classified as ""injurious"" without due process, justification, or prior notice. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"Only a limited number of species named to a ""white list"" (not yet written) would be approved to enter the U.S. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: What is the white list? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"A white list is the opposite of a black list, or ban list. Typically, bills include black/ban lists of species that state what species are not allowed. A white list includes the species that are allowed. If a species is not on the white list, then it is not allowed. In this case, the white list will determine what species can be imported into the U.S. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: What species are on the white list? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"There is no compiled white list at this time. That will happen only if the amendments pass. No one knows what species will make the white list. All we know is that a species had to be imported or transported interstate in ""greater than minimal quantities"" in the one year prior to the enactment date to even be potentially included on the white list. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: How will FWS create the white list? (FWS = U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"Only species that were imported or transported interstate in ""minimal quantities"" during the one-year period prior to enactment will be potential candidates for the white list. FWS must define minimal quantities within one year after enactment. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: What data will FWS use to create the white list? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"We do not know. This is a huge problem. For example, FWS does not have accurate or sufficient data on many of the species imported into the U.S., nor those transported interstate. CITES and/or ESA data is sometimes all that is collected. If species are not listed under CITES or ESA they may just be imported as a generic animal (i.e. tropical fish). CITES = Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and ESA = Endangered Species Act "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: What is the new emergency designation? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"The new emergency designation allows FWS to list species as injurious without due process. The listing would take effect immediately upon publication in the Federal Register. There may be a delayed effective date of up to 60 days, but only if FWS allows such. After an emergency listing, FWS may take up to three years to justify the listing. They may also decide not to permanently add the species to the injurious list. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q. Did the bill change names? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"HR4521 is still the America COMPETES Act but it will be merged with S1260. The reconciled bill has had several bill changes already. Currently, it is titled the Bipartisan Innovation Act. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: Where are we in the process? (updated 3/15/22) 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"HR4521 that contained the Lacey Act amendments of concern passed the House with a split vote on February 4. HR4521 will not be voted on by the Senate. Instead, HR4521 will be reconciled (or merged) with S1260. There have been delays due to a Senate recess, priority on budget, and other reasons. A conference committee should be formed to merge the two bills. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"It is anticipated that a formal conference committee will be formed by early/mid-April. Once created, this committee will review HR4521 and S1260. The bills will be reconciled with one final version emerging from the committee. The primary goal of S1260/HR4521 to improve America's economic strength in the technology fields is a priority so this will be a high priority for Congress. As stated, our goal is not to stop the reconciled bill but to stop the Lacey Act amendments from being included. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: Do I need to get rid of my animals if this passes? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,No. The federal law would not ban possession. Only if individual states took action might you need to rehome/surrender your animals. 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: What is S1260? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"As USARK reported on January 28, S1260 is the Senate version of HR4521 and is titled the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act (USICA). S1260 does not contain these Lacey Act amendments. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: How is USARK so sure they have the right interpretation? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"We are very plainly stating what the legislation would do, how the Lacey Act will be amended, and what new authority FWS would have. We understand the legislative language can be confusing. USARK's analysis of the Lacey Act amendments in Section 71102 of the America COMPETES Act (HR4521) has been vetted by numerous attorneys, legislative experts, and other authorities. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: Does the white list apply to every state? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"This is a federal law and the white list applies to importation into the U.S. Individual states can write their own laws that are more restrictive, but not less restrictive than the federal law. This means states cannot opt to allow for interstate movement of species listed as injurious. It is possible that states may write laws that reflect the federal law regarding the white list and could ban species not on the white list (or even species that are on the white list) as they see fit. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: Are injurious species banned from possession/ownership? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"No. If a species is listed as injurious it is not banned from possession. However, individual states may choose to ban the possession of injurious species (or other species), as we have seen previously. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: Can I breed and sell injurious species? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"Yes. As long as a species is not banned by state law, you can breed and sell that species within the same state (intrastate), even if it is listed as injurious by FWS. If these amendments pass, it would become illegal to transport them across state lines. However, state or local laws may place further restrictions on species. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: Does a species need to be invasive in most of the U.S. to be listed as injurious? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"No. A species may be listed as injurious even if it is not invasive in the U.S. If there is even an interpreted possibility it might become invasive, it could be listed, as we have already seen. Also, while that invasive threat can be limited to an isolated area, like southern Florida, the species could still be federally listed as injurious and banned from movement between any of the states. Even if the potentially affected state has already banned or regulated the species, FWS can still list it as injurious. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: What does injurious mean? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"Per FWS, a species may be listed if it could be, ""injurious to human beings, to the interests of agriculture, horticulture, forestry, or to wildlife or the wildlife resources of the United States."" In some cases, injurious is the same as ""invasive."" If a species could potentially be invasive and cause any type of harm anywhere in the U.S. then it could be listed as injurious. Listings can also occur because a species might carry/transport a disease. We saw this when FWS used an emergency rule to list 201 species of salamanders as injurious due to the concern that an animal might have Bsal (Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans) chytrid fungus. Other reasons could generate listings such as possible threats to human health or agriculture. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: Does this only apply to commerce/sales across state lines? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"No. If passed, all interstate movement, for any reason, would be banned. It would even be illegal to take an animal across state lines for veterinary care, or job/family relocation. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: Are military members exempt? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,No. This would hit military service men and women especially hard as they are relocated often. Not even active-duty service members would be allowed to take pets listed as injurious with them across state lines. 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q. Are there any articles about this? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"Yes. There are several articles, podcasts, videos, and interviews on this topic now. Below are two articles: "

24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Veterinarians voice concerns about proposed Lacey Act amendment by Jennifer Fiala via URL: https://usark.org/lacey1a/ 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: Do we know when Congress will vote? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,There is not a set timeline and a formal reconciliation of HR4521 and S1260 has not yet started. Any bill would need to pass before the end of session in December. 2022 is the second year of the two-year session (117th session of Congress). 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q. Should I contact the local offices? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"Yes. Call the local House and Senate offices and speak directly to staff. Politely explain who you are, what you do, and why you are opposed. Local offices have a direct line to the D.C. offices. If you have a business or facility, you can invite staff to visit. Representatives and Senators will have offices in both D.C. and in their states of representation. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q. Should I meet with my legislators? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"Yes! You should definitely request meetings with legislators. Be prepared (read our alert and Talking Points at https://usark.org/2022lacey/) and be professional. Never feel intimidated. Your taxes pay their salaries and they are there to listen. Also, if you meet with staff, that is fine. They will pass along your message to the legislators. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: Can I just get a license to take my animal with me to a new state? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,No. There are some very limited exemptions that allow for such a license but almost no one would be eligible. 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: I am against illegal wildlife trafficking and this sounds like a good thing! 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"While another section of the Lacey Act is used to address wildlife trafficking, that is not what these amendments are about. This has nothing to do with wildlife trafficking. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q. Will this help shut down illegal wildlife trafficking? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"No. Illegal wildlife trafficking is already illegal, obviously. Misapplied laws like this only encourage and increase criminal activities because it drives the prices up for black market animals. This action is actually counterproductive to halting illegal trafficking. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"Q: My Senator responded and said that the Lacey Act amendments were removed from the Senate COMPETES Act, so the coast is clear, right? "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,There is no Senate COMPETES Act. The America COMPETES is a House bill. The Senate version of the America COMPETES Act is S1260 and that bill never contained the Lacey Act amendments (so it would be impossible to remove them since they were never there to begin with). Also know that most responses are pre-written and not written exclusively in response to your emails/letters. 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: My Senator responded and said that the Lacey Act amendments don't do what you said they do. 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"Federal legislators and staff are working on many issues. There may be miscommunication or a mistake as to the issue being discussed. The legislator or staff may also not have a good understanding of these Lacey Act amendments. Additionally, remember that legislators do not enforce laws! Once a bill becomes a law, the enforcement agency (in this case it is FWS) must write its regulation that reflects the legislation. The regulation will be much more complex than the legislative statute. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: How does the transportation ban work? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"If passed, it will become illegal to transport any species listed as injurious under the Lacey Act across state lines. It is already illegal to import an injurious species into the U.S. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: What happens with species not included on the white list? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"Species not on the white list cannot be imported into the U.S. These species would not be banned from interstate transport unless also listed as injurious. Note that this is how the statute would read, but this could change during either the legislative or FWS rulemaking process. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: How can I help stop this? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Contact your legislator with your opposition! We have instructions and more in our alert at https://USARK.org/2022Lacey/. 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: I read that amendment 599 removed this section about the Lacey Act. 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,That is wrong. Amendment 599 to HR4521 was proposed by Arkansas Representative Crawford but it was not added to the bill. Amendment 599 would have removed Section 71102 from HR4521 if it had received enough votes. People who were unfamiliar with the legislative process were misreading what was posted by the House Committee on Rules. 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: I want more information! Can you send me a PM? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,All available details are included in our alert and related posts. 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: Does it never end? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"It really does not end. No one court case or legislative discussion will stop issues like these from coming up. Proposed legislation/regulation can happen at any time at any level of government (federal, state, county, or city). This is why USARK tirelessly watches for such issues and creates alerts that make it easy for you to learn and take action. We must always be vigilant. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: What politician was responsible? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"We do not know which politician is responsible for Section 71102 of the America COMPETES Act (HR4521). We only know that HR4521 was originally introduced on 7/19/21 as the Bioeconomy Research and Development Act of 2021 (did not initially contain the Lacey Act amendments), sat without a hearing, and then reemerged as the America COMPETES Act on 1/28/22 (the same day that USARK found and reported the problem) with Section 71102. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: Does this include invertebrates? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"Yes. We know that aquatic invertebrates are included. While the legislation does not mention terrestrial invertebrates, FWS can regulate terrestrial invertebrates (i.e., Endangered Species Act), and terrestrial invertebrates are included in the FWS definition of wildlife: "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"""Wildlife is any living or dead wild animal, its parts, and products made from it. Wildlife not only includes mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish, but also invertebrates such as insects, crustaceans, arthropods, molluscs and coelenterates."" – FWS "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"Also, within the Lacey Act the term ""fish or wildlife"" means: any wild animal, whether alive or dead, including without limitation any wild mammal, bird, reptile, amphibian, fish, mollusk, crustacean, arthropod, coelenterate, or other invertebrate, whether or not bred, hatched, or born in captivity, and includes any part, product, egg, or offspring thereof. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"Q: This only includes wild animals so the animals I breed are okay to sell and move across the U.S., right? "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"Wrong. Animals will be listed by species. It does not matter if the animals are wild-caught or bred under human care. It also does not matter if the animals have wild-type coloration or a ""morph"" pattern/coloration. Some people are confused because the language reads, ""...wild mammals, wild birds, fish (including mollusks and crustacea), amphibians, or reptiles, or the offspring or eggs of any such species..."" What matters is the species of the animal. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: What is the effective date? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,The effective date is one year after the date of enactment (date it is signed into law). 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"Q: USARK is the only group I see talking about this. If this was so bad, other groups would have alerts. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"Many other groups do have alerts and are opposing these amendments. Just because you have not seen it does not mean it is not happening. Groups/businesses/keepers in aquaculture, aviculture, and mammals are all opposing this, along with herpetoculturists and USARK. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: Where can I read the Lacey Act amendments? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,You can read Section 71102 of HR4521 at https://USARK.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-HR4521-excerpt.pdf. This language is the same as found in S626. You can read S626 at https://USARK.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-S626-Lacey-Act.pdf. 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: I heard HR4521 changed before it was sent to the Senate. Are these Lacey Act amendments still there? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"Yes. The final HR4521 text that was sent to the Senate after additional House floor amendments were added is 3,610 pages. The Lacey Act amendments found in Section 71102 now begin on page 2,060. You can read the full bill at https://USARK.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2022-HR4521-COMPETES-final.pdf. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: I saw an animal group supporting this. Why do they support it? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Animal rights groups (groups trying to ban and remove all animals from our lives) are supporting this effort. They typically provide misinformation about what these amendments will do in order to gain further support. We have even seen them lie and say this will not affect common pet species. This is simply not true! No one knows what species will be listed and we have already seen common pet species listed as injurious. These animal rights groups have no problem with misleading the public and spending lots of money to create and distribute their agenda pushing propaganda (rather than actually helping animals or conservation as they claim to do). 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: Why does USARK not know about S1260? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"We do! We posted this bill by its name, the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act (USICA), on January 28 with our original alert. We have been talking about USICA/S1260 since day one. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: Why does USARK not know about the conference committee? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,We do know about it! We have been discussing HR4521 and S1260 being reconciled (which is what happens with two similar bills in a conference committee) for many weeks and before anyone else reported this (that we are aware of). 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: Can individual states overturn/oppose the Lacey Act amendments if they pass? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,No. States cannot allow federally listed injurious species to be transported across state lines. 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: Why aren't you telling people that this is only being supported along party lines? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"While the legislative issues we post about may sometimes appear to be tied up in partisan politics, the activists pushing for these initiatives are not limited to working with only one party or another. HR4521 did pass along party lines (Democratic support) and we reported the 222 to 210 vote the day it passed the House. However, S626 is sponsored by a Republican. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: I read that the Lacey Act amendments were only proposed as an amendment to HR4521 but did not get added to the bill. 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"This is wrong. There was another amendment to the Lacey Act introduced as HR4521 Amendment 252 by Illinois Representative Quigley. This was an amendment version of the Big Cat Public Safety Act regarding large cats (lions, tigers, etc.). This is a very different Lacey Act amendment. Persons not well-versed with the Congressional amendment process misread what was posted by the House Committee on Rules. Amendment 252 was withdrawn. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: Why was this added as a last-minute amendment to HR4521? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"These Lacey Act amendments were not a formal amendment to HR4521. They comprise a section of HR4521 (Section 71102). Since this section was included within the text of the America COMPETES Act, it is not actually a formal amendment to the America COMPETES Act. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: I spoke to a legislator's office and they said that the species I work with will be okay because it is common in trade. 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"This is wrong. First, legislators and their staff do not enforce laws. Law enforcement officers for FWS will be enforcing this law and they must enforce what the law says, not what a legislative staff person told you. Second, just because a species is common in trade does not mean it will not be listed as injurious. Some species already listed were common in trade but they were still listed as injurious. Being common in trade also does not mean it will be automatically added onto the white list. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"Q: This will not impact animal species already being imported, traded, or transported. There is an exemption clause. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"This is wrong. Only species imported in ""minimal quantities"" would qualify for the new importation white list. Qualifying does not mean they will be included on the white list. Not only must they have been imported and/or transported interstate within the one year before enactment (not two or more years ago), but they must also have been imported in ""greater than minimal quantities."" FWS gets to define minimal quantity later. Additionally, even if a species has been heavily represented in trade, it can still be listed as injurious and we have witnessed this. There is no exemption that makes any species automatically safe. As mentioned previously, there is also insufficient data for importation on many species and possibly no good data for interstate transportation. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: Can species be included on the white list even if they are not imported in greater than minimal quantities? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"Yes, but it is an exhaustive process that must be paid for by the appropriate industry/businesses. Only the Secretary of the Department of Interior (FWS falls under the Department of the Interior) can add a species not meeting the ""imported in greater than quantities"" qualifier to the white list, if it ""does not pose a significant risk of invasiveness to the United States."" This means it cannot be invasive anywhere in the United States. Research findings (paid for by the relevant industry) would need to prove this. If those against us (they are very well funded) did their own science that disagreed, then FWS could choose either finding for the basis of their ruling. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: I read that this applies only to high-risk invasive species. 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,This is incorrect. We have already witnessed listings for species that may be able to become invasive and also listings for reasons other than invasive potential. 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"Q. USARK is the only organization that I know of that interprets the Lacey Act Amendments to mean that if a species is not on either white or black (deemed injurious) list, then this species can be transported across state lines. Everyone else says ""not on white list"" = ""automatically on black list."" "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"We have properly conveyed what is stated in the bill. This portion of the Lacey Act amendments is titled ""PRESUMPTIVE PROHIBITION ON IMPORTATION."" Additionally, the text clearly states, ""IMPORTATION into the United States of any species of wild mammals, wild birds, fish (including mollusks and crustacea), amphibians, or reptiles, or the offspring or eggs of any such species,..."" Again, it clearly states the white list only applies to importation. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"However, we could see states banning species that do not appear on the FWS white list. Additionally, FWS could list every species that does not appear on the white list as injurious utilizing its new emergency designation. For instance, FWS could make a ruling that it is a risk to transport species not on the white list interstate until they can determine if a species cannot be invasive. Species not appearing on the white list would be in a constant limbo of being listed as injurious at any time. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"The short answer is that the bill would not ban interstate transport of species not on the white list, but that interstate ban is still a possibility for species not on the white list (even if they are not formally listed as injurious). There is no way to be certain that species not on the white list could still be transported interstate after this is final (if it passes) and goes through FWS rulemaking. "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: I got a response from my legislator saying he/she supports this! What can I do now? 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Southwestern Herpetologists Society 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"Please read the reply carefully. Many legislators have automatic reply emails. You may get a canned response supporting animal welfare, for example, and not these Lacey Act amendments specifically. Even if a legislator states he/she may support these Lacey Act amendments, that does not mean you cannot continue to educate. Remember that legislators and their staff are working on many issues and may not have a good grasp on the consequences. It is okay to be a squeaky wheel and send multiple messages. It is also very unlikely that a legislator had time to read your email and reply exclusively to you. Canned emails are written and then just sent as replies to people on a certain topic that may be as broad as ""animal."" "
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,Q: I heard this only applies to minks and mink farming. 
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"There is an amendment to HR4521 that bans ""import, export, transport, sale, receipt, acquirement, or purchase in interstate or foreign commerce of mink [dead or alive]."" That is separate from the Lacey Act amendments we are directly concerned with, but the mink ban also amends the Lacey Act. Our alert regards section 71102 of HR4521 as it was introduced when retitled the America COMPETES Act. The mink issue was an amendment to HR4521 added on the House floor."
24,2022-04-04,UN climate panel calls for historic shift to renewable energy,"Bearded dragons, the most common pet reptile, could be banned in your state if the anonymous amendments to the COMPETES Act are passed by the US Senate Children admire box turtles at the Chumash Indian Museum; all exotic pets, including fish, would be in peril if the Lacey Act amendments pass"
25,2022-04-04,Debate over pivotal climate report breaks record,"Dead frogs have been found in large numbers across eastern Australia, particularly south eastern Queensland and NSW including the Blue Mountains, with 26 native species identified so far. The most commonly reported is the Green Tree Frog (Litoria caerulea)."
25,2022-04-04,Debate over pivotal climate report breaks record,"Peron's Tree Frog (Litoria peronii), the Striped Marsh Frog (Limnodynastes peronii) and the Eastern Banjo Frog (Limnodynastes dumerilii) are the next most reported, all common and beloved species throughout the Mountains."
25,2022-04-04,Debate over pivotal climate report breaks record,"Frogs are a vital part of our ecosystem. They control invertebrate populations and play an important role in the food web for many birds, mammals and reptiles. This mass mortality event is therefore very concerning, and experts aren't yet sure why it's happening."
25,2022-04-04,Debate over pivotal climate report breaks record,"Amphibians are susceptible to a range of pathogens; in fact, they have been fighting a pandemic of their own for years, caused by the amphibian chytrid fungus. This disease attacks the frog's skin, affecting the way they breath, drink and function within their bodies. This fungus thrives in cold, damp environments. It may be taking a greater hold of our frogs due to colder weather, it may be a novel pathogen, or something else altogether."

26,2022-04-05,Global hub launched to help countries slash methane emissions,"Dr Jodi Rowley, FrogID lead scientist, said ""we need people's help to understand how our frogs are doing and whether they have disappeared"". Frogs face various threats such as climate change, bushfires, flood, drought, habitat loss and disease."
26,2022-04-05,Global hub launched to help countries slash methane emissions,"She urged people to record frogs in backyards, bush, paddocks, dams, remote outback areas, rainforests, mountain slopes and farms. ""We are missing even basic information on frogs. There are areas in Australia that have no scientific records of frogs, even though they are there."""
26,2022-04-05,Global hub launched to help countries slash methane emissions,"Dr Rowley said Australia had about 240 known species of native frogs, with more than 30 under threat from extinction."
26,2022-04-05,Global hub launched to help countries slash methane emissions,"""They're threatened by so many things. They're really sensitive indicators of environmental health,"" she said, adding they were dying in large numbers this year."
26,2022-04-05,Global hub launched to help countries slash methane emissions,Older people often tell Dr Rowley that they remember the days when frogs would cover windows and give off a chorus of croaks.
26,2022-04-05,Global hub launched to help countries slash methane emissions,"""It hit our frogs and frogs around the world a lot. That's probably the biggest reason for quieter times for frogs unfortunately,"" she said. ""That caused the extinction of at least four species of Australian frogs."""

"
46,2022-04-10,We Put Off the Need to ACT NOW on Climate Change at Our Peril," After 17 years of believing that this species was extinct in the country, presumably due to the chytrid fungus that ""attacks"" amphibian populations, several experts and organizations joined forces in a project to conserve and evaluate the population status of the Atelopus tricolor. "

46,2022-04-10,We Put Off the Need to ACT NOW on Climate Change at Our Peril,"To do this they made a series of trips in which they found more specimens of this type of toads characterized by the yellow, black and red colors of its body that measures between 23 to 34 millimeters depending on whether it is male or female, explained the herpetologist Mendoza. "
46,2022-04-10,We Put Off the Need to ACT NOW on Climate Change at Our Peril," The Tricolored Harlequin Toad lives in the eastern Andes of Bolivia and Peru and are ""closely associated with bodies of water"", currently there are no records of the species in Peru, so Bolivia would be hosting the only population of this species. "
46,2022-04-10,We Put Off the Need to ACT NOW on Climate Change at Our Peril," The conservation of this toad is of great importance because it is the only representative of this genus of amphibians for Bolivia and plays the role of pest controller, such as mosquitoes, which contributes to having a ""balance in the food chain,"" Mendoza emphasized."
46,2022-04-10,We Put Off the Need to ACT NOW on Climate Change at Our Peril,"Among the main threats identified so far is water pollution with plastic bottles, cans or the use of detergents in these water sources that affect these populations of amphibians. "
46,2022-04-10,We Put Off the Need to ACT NOW on Climate Change at Our Peril," In the same way, the loss of their habitat due to the fragmentation of forests is one of the main concerns, as there are several plots of crops in the area to produce coffee, coca and some fruits, for example."

A group of researchers supported by Fapesp found an unprecedented mortality of little frogs that develop away from the aquatic environment in the Atlantic Forest. The amphibians were infected with high loads of the chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis), which causes chytridiomycosis."
48,2022-04-05,"UN: 18 nations have gone green on climate, raked in green","The study, published in the journal Biological Conservation, lights up a warning about the threat of the pathogen also on amphibians of terrestrial habits, which have important ecological functions, such as the control of insects that transmit diseases like dengue, yellow fever and zika."

When infection occurs, there is a physiological imbalance and the animal ends up dying of heart attack,"" explains Diego Moura-Campos, first author of the study, conducted during his master's degree at the Institute of Biology, University of Campinas (IB-Unicamp), with a scholarship from the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (Capes)."
48,2022-04-05,"UN: 18 nations have gone green on climate, raked in green","The research was conducted under the project ""The chytrid fungus in Brazil: from its origin to its consequences"", linked to the BIOTA-FAPESP Program and coordinated by Luís Felipe Toledo, professor of IB-Unicamp, who also signs the study."
48,2022-04-05,"UN: 18 nations have gone green on climate, raked in green","""We study the fungus under several aspects, but we rarely have this unfortunate opportunity to see animals dying in nature from the infection. This is the first study showing this in Brazil. If an amphibian dies and is contaminated, it doesn't mean that it died because of the fungus. It could be living well with the pathogen and not develop the disease. In this case, we were sure of the cause of death because the animals were showing symptoms of the disease: rickets, with loose skin and very high infection loads"", says Toledo, who coordinates another project focused on understanding how the fungus spreads in nature."
48,2022-04-05,"UN: 18 nations have gone green on climate, raked in green","The researchers believe that the species that develop directly, meaning they spend their entire life cycle on land, without passing through the tadpole stage, are even less adapted to the fungus. Because they have had longer contact with the pathogen, species that live in water may have built up some resistance to infection."
48,2022-04-05,"UN: 18 nations have gone green on climate, raked in green","The mortality was observed by Moura-Campos during research in the Serra do Japi Municipal Biological Reserve, in Jundiaí (SP), between May 2018 and May 2019.

48,2022-04-05,"UN: 18 nations have gone green on climate, raked in green","""These animals are very small and difficult to find. When they die they soon decompose. Finding nine of them dead or sick in a short interval of time, as happened, indicates that many others probably died"", says Guilherme Becker, professor at the University of Alabama, in the United States, another participant in the research."
48,2022-04-05,"UN: 18 nations have gone green on climate, raked in green","According to the researcher, who is also a visiting professor at the Graduate Program in Ecology at Unicamp, the study shows that the acceleration of global climate change in the coming decades should increase the occurrence of this type of disease, whose causers may evolve into more virulent strains, including due to the emergence of hybrids, as shown in a previous work of the group."
48,2022-04-05,"UN: 18 nations have gone green on climate, raked in green","""Due to the lack of humidity in the forest floor where they live, these animals may have gone to hydrate in streams and became more contaminated by the fungus than usual,"" he says."
48,2022-04-05,"UN: 18 nations have gone green on climate, raked in green",Another hypothesis raised by the researchers is that periods of drought can compromise the immune system of the frogs and make them more vulnerable to the fungus.

50,2022-04-04,Guardian: Media 'Barely Reporting' UN Climate Catastrophe Warnings," MADRID, 11 (EUROPA PRESS)"
50,2022-04-04,Guardian: Media 'Barely Reporting' UN Climate Catastrophe Warnings," Biologists have settled a centuries-old debate by confirming that a single species of frog, of the more than 7,000 that live today, has real teeth in the lower jaw."
50,2022-04-04,Guardian: Media 'Barely Reporting' UN Climate Catastrophe Warnings," The protagonist, a large marsupial frog called Gastrotheca guentheri, has baffled scientists since its discovery in 1882 by possessing what appeared to be a complete set of dagger-sharp teeth in the upper and lower mouth."
50,2022-04-04,Guardian: Media 'Barely Reporting' UN Climate Catastrophe Warnings," Since then, scientists have doubted the exact nature of these structures. True teeth are composed of specific tissues, including dentin and enamel, which are notoriously difficult to observe in frog teeth because of their diminutive size."
50,2022-04-04,Guardian: Media 'Barely Reporting' UN Climate Catastrophe Warnings," ""They are incredibly small, each about the size of a grain of sand,"" lead author Daniel Paluh, a doctoral candidate in the University of Florida's biology department, said in a statement. ""There is no way to confirm the presence of dentin and enamel in frog teeth without using high-resolution techniques."""
50,2022-04-04,Guardian: Media 'Barely Reporting' UN Climate Catastrophe Warnings," Frogs have been missing teeth in the lower jaw since they first appeared in the fossil record more than 200 million years ago. Therefore, a single living species with a complete dentition seemed unlikely at best and contradicted an ancient biological theory, called Dollo's Law, which states that once a complex trait is lost in an organism, it never returns."
50,2022-04-04,Guardian: Media 'Barely Reporting' UN Climate Catastrophe Warnings," But frogs have been known to flout the rules when it comes to teeth. Although their basic body shape and anatomy have remained virtually unchanged since the Jurassic period, Paluh and his colleagues recently determined that frogs have lost teeth on more than 20 separate occasions and may have regained them six more times over the course of their evolutionary history."
50,2022-04-04,Guardian: Media 'Barely Reporting' UN Climate Catastrophe Warnings," Some species, such as those that feed on ants and termites, lack teeth altogether and rely instead on their sticky, projectile tongues to gather food. Frogs that go after larger morsels are often equipped with a row of teeth in the upper jaw and a serrated, jagged palate at the top of the mouth, which helps prevent moving prey from escaping."
50,2022-04-04,Guardian: Media 'Barely Reporting' UN Climate Catastrophe Warnings," In rare cases, some species have evolved large bony tusks that protrude from their lower jaw and superficially resemble teeth, but lack the apron tissues of dentin and enamel. And instead of the conveyor belt system of tooth replacement in other frogs, the tusks grow only once and cannot be replaced."
50,2022-04-04,Guardian: Media 'Barely Reporting' UN Climate Catastrophe Warnings," For decades, no one was sure whether the lower jaw structures of G. guentheri were bones disguised as teeth or the genuine article. Finding a specimen to settle the question wasn't easy either. Native to the cloud forests of Colombia and Ecuador, the last recorded sighting of G. guentheri was in 1996, raising fears that the species has since succumbed to extinction."
50,2022-04-04,Guardian: Media 'Barely Reporting' UN Climate Catastrophe Warnings," A handful of G. guentheri are preserved as museum specimens, but given their rarity, biologists are hesitant to subject them to the kind of destructive analyses that would be necessary to study their teeth. But Paluh was able to take advantage of a peculiar feature of Gastrotheca biology to use a preserved embryo as a specimen instead of a full-size adult."
50,2022-04-04,Guardian: Media 'Barely Reporting' UN Climate Catastrophe Warnings," Instead of laying eggs in ponds or streams, female marsupial frogs carry them in a pouch on their backs. ""In the case of G. guentheri, these eggs skip the tadpole stage and hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult called froglets,"" Paluh said."
50,2022-04-04,Guardian: Media 'Barely Reporting' UN Climate Catastrophe Warnings," In their study, published in Evolution, the researchers took CT scans of the embryo's jaws and carefully stained razor-thin sections of individual teeth with dyes that bind to enamel and dentin, with unambiguous results. The teeth of G. guentheri were virtually identical to those of other frog species in their overall shape, development and the tissues of which they were composed."
50,2022-04-04,Guardian: Media 'Barely Reporting' UN Climate Catastrophe Warnings," ""This was surprising given the extreme time since they were lost and recovered,"" Paluh said. ""Our expectation was that if they got their teeth back, they would somehow be different, but that's not what we saw at all."""
50,2022-04-04,Guardian: Media 'Barely Reporting' UN Climate Catastrophe Warnings," As for how structures that have been absent for millions of years reappeared in an otherwise unassuming frog, Paluh suspects the answer lies in the complex dental developmental pathway retained in most living amphibians. Although the location of teeth may vary from species to species, the same basic genetics likely underlie their development, and producing them in the lower jaw could be as simple as flipping a switch."
50,2022-04-04,Guardian: Media 'Barely Reporting' UN Climate Catastrophe Warnings," Paluh plans to leverage several genetic tools in the near future to map the contours of tooth development and evolution in frogs, but for G. guentheri and a number of other endangered species in the U.S. tropics, the exact answer may no longer be possible. DNA degrades over time in plants and animals stored in museum collections, and the small number of aged specimens of G. guentheri are probably not viable resources for genetic study."
50,2022-04-04,Guardian: Media 'Barely Reporting' UN Climate Catastrophe Warnings," ""We've seen many species in this group endangered by climate change, habitat degradation and chytrid fungus disease,"" Paluh said. ""We won't be able to answer these questions in any other group, because these traits don't exist anywhere else on the tree of life."" "

55,2022-04-06,Costa Rica's 'leave it in the ground' policy in doubt after election,Wading through a moonlit pond on Australia’s east coast talking to frogs makes Michael Mahony feel like a kid again.
55,2022-04-06,Costa Rica's 'leave it in the ground' policy in doubt after election,"The 70-year-old biology professor and conservationist at Australia’s University of Newcastle has mastered imitating and understanding the shrills, croaks and whistles of frogs. "
55,2022-04-06,Costa Rica's 'leave it in the ground' policy in doubt after election," “Sometimes you forget to work because ... you just want to talk to the frogs for a while and it’s sort of good fun,” Mahony told Reuters from a pond in Cooranbong, New South Wales. He is thrilled every time they call back, but fears frogs are increasingly at risk of going silent. "
55,2022-04-06,Costa Rica's 'leave it in the ground' policy in doubt after election,"Australia has about 240 frog species, but around 30% of them are threatened by climate change, water pollution, habitat loss and the chytrid fungus. Mahony said globally, frogs were the most threatened of all vertebrates. "
55,2022-04-06,Costa Rica's 'leave it in the ground' policy in doubt after election,"Beyond working to preserve amphibian habitats across Australia, Mahony has helped to develop a cryopreservation method to help bring frogs back from the edge of extinction by “banking” genetic material. "
55,2022-04-06,Costa Rica's 'leave it in the ground' policy in doubt after election," “What we’ve done in the face of the problems of catastrophic loss of species is to establish the first genome bank for Australian frogs,” he said. "
55,2022-04-06,Costa Rica's 'leave it in the ground' policy in doubt after election," Mahony’s passion for conservation has also rubbed off on his students. One of them, Simon Clulow, named a newly discovered frog “Mahony’s toadlet” in his honour in 2016. "
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"On 15 December 2014, inside a repurposed shipping container in the Atlanta Botanical Garden in the USA, Mark Mandica heard an unfamiliar animal call."
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,He was believed to be the last Rabbs' fringe-limbed tree frog in the world.
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"""I was always extremely curious what the call sounded like ... it was a loud call that sounded like a barking dog ,"" Mandica says."
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"""Then it struck me that this frog was still vital and sounded very strong, and was singing out for a mate that would never come."""
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"When Toughie's heart stopped on 26 September 2016, the species died out. The next morning, across the country in San Diego, amphibian expert Natalie Calatayud was presented with Toughie's testicles."
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"This strange gift was part of a plan to use ""biobanking"" for conservation. The idea of freezing biological material is not new, having been used in medical research and livestock breeding programs for decades. But by using liquid nitrogen to lower animal tissues to -196C, where almost all processes of life within a cell halt, scientists hope to buy more time for assisted reproduction to help a captive colony, to investigate a devastating disease, or preserve DNA for cloning."
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"Unlike the Rabbs' tree frog, most species disappear years before humans realise, along with any chance to preserve their genetic material."
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"A group of scientists in Australia, in the grip of one of the world's worst extinction crises, is hoping that some of our own endangered species can avoid this fate. They are calling for a national operation to freeze our native wildlife before that chance is lost."
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499, 'Australia has lagged behind' 
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,Australia was the first country to attempt a truly national biobank: the Animal Gene Storage and Resource Centre of Australia (now the Australian Frozen Zoo) was created in 1995.
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"But funding and donations dried up, says its current director, reproductive expert Peter Temple-Smith. It could never fulfil its potential. The ""zoo"" exists as a two-metre-tall cryotank that's been shuffled around Monash University, reliant on volunteer staff formally employed in other roles."
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"Meanwhile, co-founder and former director Ian Gunn says biobanking for conservation has been gaining popularity overseas."
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"""Other countries have moved ahead, and Australia has completely lagged behind."""
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"Alongside the original, and languishing Frozen Zoo, there are now scattered facilities that cryo-preserve animal samples in pockets across the country at some zoos, universities, and museums."
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"Even with their wish to create a national strategy for proactively ""banking"" priority species, it will be too late for some: the government itself predicts 280 animals and plants will be extinct by 2039. "
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"For these animals, their suspended cells may be the species' last hope."
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"Reproductive biologist Rebecca Hobbs, of the Taronga CryoDiversity Bank in New South Wales, did not attend the meeting with Box, but says national operating procedures for collecting, storing, and using samples would be crucial."
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"Biobanking, she stresses, must work with, not replace, habitat protection and captive breeding."
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"This is where advocates say biobanking is useful: in the US, researchers have reversed the black-footed ferret population out of an inbreeding spiral using frozen sperm from the ""founding ferrets"", and even cloned a ferret from skin frozen in the 1980s."
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"Banking species in the threatened-to-near-threatened categories may be most cost-effective, Hobbs says. ""You may get more bang for your buck if you apply it to species that haven't declined so much that the genetic variability has declined too dramatically for it to work."""
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"Now back in Australia, Calatayud says current conservation strategies aren't working, nor being done at the necessary scale."
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"""The need for captive populations to maintain threatened species is growing at an alarming rate, disproportionate to the funding available and the logistical availability of space and staff. With biobanking, you could manage a smaller captive population by inserting new genetics whenever you needed to."""
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,She says that biobanking domesticated species has been long accepted. Australia also has a national network to bank seeds of native plants.
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"""Farmers everywhere bank their bull semen ... and no one bats an eyelid. But in the context of wildlife, suddenly people think you're selling some pipe dream."""
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499, Big decisions and a leap of faith 
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,Deciding which species get banked will be gruelling. Some won't make it.
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"""It's a huge judgment call, it's unfair, but it's a case of, 'who do I bank to save this ecosystem'? Who do we save for the greater good, because we can't save everybody,"" Calatayud says."
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"Conservation biologist Simon Clulow, of the University of Canberra and Newcastle University, says that amphibians and reptiles are the ""most imperiled vertebrate classes on Earth"" but have had the least attention when it comes to biobanking."
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"""It really wasn't until the start of this century that we and one or two other labs around the world started to really look at developing sperm freezing and IVF techniques in frogs ... for reptiles, we're about 20 years behind that."""
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"Some years ago Clulow and his father, John, helped produce live embryos of the extinct gastric brooding frog from tissue samples frozen decades ago."
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"""We should absolutely be doing it, right now ... You can't go back in time once a species has disappeared."""
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"John Clulow, who attended the Canberra meeting with Box, feels cautiously optimistic that momentum is building toward a national bank. "
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"If we could develop [the method] in the saltwater crocodile, we could apply it to other species."
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499, Steve Johnston 
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"An ecologist with expertise in reproductive technologies, he and colleagues at the University of Newcastle recently received federal funding to collect sperm from frogs in bushfire-affected areas, for use in captive breeding programs at Taronga."
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,He says some conservationists worry that habitat protection will lag if the species in it have been preserved.
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"""The other thing is, philosophically, conservationists are often about preserving animals within habitats, whereas this is a technological approach and that's not as culturally embraced."""
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,Reproductive biologist Steve Johnston says it's too late to be hands-off.
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"""With the koalas in south-east Queensland, we're down to the point where if you just leave them alone, they're just going to die,"" says Johnston, of the University of Queensland."
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"""Even with all the funding and publicity that they get, they're still struggling."""
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"Less charismatic species, like reptiles and amphibians, tend to attract less funding and interest. Johnston is a pioneer of the technique for successfully extracting sperm from the largest reptile alive. Lacking funding for specific facilities, he worked with Koorana Crocodile Farm."
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"""If we could develop [the method] in the saltwater crocodile, we could apply it to other species."""
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"Once it was laid across the back of two flat-tray utes, Johnston could crawl underneath to extract the penis from the slit at the junction of its legs and tail, and ""milk"" the sperm. The technique is now being used by different groups."
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"""It's somewhat invasive ... but works well without causing any trauma to the animal."""
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499, Hope and silence 
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"The group has not heard from the commissioner's office since their March meeting. Box left the role in October and a spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment did not answer whether acting commissioner Fiona Fraser was briefed about the proposal."
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"They say the Threatened Species Strategy 2021-31 , which includes one mention of biobanking, ""recognises the importance of being prepared."""
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"Mark Mandica is also preparing. He has mixed feelings about reviving extinct species; the need to remove them from the wild for their survival, he says, is ""profoundly dark""."
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,But to hear a Rabbs' tree frog call again would fill his heart.
56,2022-04-11,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #499,"""Sometimes, I think about how maybe there's a remote population of them out there, gliding from tree to tree, that just haven't been found yet."""

59,2022-04-08,My latest piece in The Conversation,Lake Titicaca frogs are officially named after the lake on the border between Peru and Bolivia where they can be found. These aquatic frogs spend most of their lives deep underwater using the saggy folds of skin that earn them their unfortunate nickname to absorb oxygen.
59,2022-04-08,My latest piece in The Conversation,"This species is unique.

64,2022-04-04,Hot carbon air,"On Aug. 14, R. Murray Schafer, the avant-garde composer who got many to use their ears rather than their eyes, passed away at the age of 88, leaving the world a little more silent. The artist, born in Sarnia, Ont., was a pioneer of acoustic ecology (he coined the term soundscape), practising field recording to capture sounds of all kinds, and often using them in musical compositions."
64,2022-04-04,Hot carbon air,Texte/Text
64,2022-04-04,Hot carbon air,"His interests were as vast as the sonic worlds he committed to tape: He pioneered using graphic notation in his scores, was a visual artist, wrote books and created musical theatre such as Apocalypsis, his sprawling 500-person piece from 1980 about the end times, structured in two parts: the world's destruction followed by its reconstruction. In 2015, it was restaged during the Luminato Festival with a cast of more than 1,000 people, making it the largest musical production in Toronto's history."
64,2022-04-04,Hot carbon air,"But even more significantly, along with getting Canadian noise laws altered, Mr. Schafer founded the World Soundscape Project at Simon Fraser University, which involved education about the idea of noise pollution and the sounds we're constantly immersed in, as well as recording and cataloguing them internationally to preserve ones that disappear."
64,2022-04-04,Hot carbon air,There are many others like Mr. Schafer. The composer influenced curious creatives who hear the wild's distress cries and fill up hard drives with recordings of ecosystems all over the world.
64,2022-04-04,Hot carbon air,"Their aim is to create aural experiences, but also to sound the alarm through actual sounds, or the disappearance thereof."
64,2022-04-04,Hot carbon air,"In a 2009 National Film Board short documentary called Listen by David New, Mr. Schafer says: ""In a way, the world is a huge composition, a huge musical composition that's going on all the time without a beginning and presumably without an ending.

64,2022-04-04,Hot carbon air,"We walked along the Massawippi River in Lennoxville, Que., until he stopped next to a silent corn field drying out in the cooling air and turned down an empty row."
64,2022-04-04,Hot carbon air,"Though Mr. Krause started recording in the wild for musical purposes rather than preservation, his work has become a massive aural archive filled with many sounds that have otherwise disappeared entirely. He's captured more than 5,000 hours worth of habitats, and half of those no longer exist as they do in his recordings. That his ambitious work turned into an impressive auditory database is rather a result of hindsight."
64,2022-04-04,Hot carbon air,"The opposite is true for Italian electro-acoustic researcher David Monacchi. His field-recording trips have been conducted with the express purpose of preservation, in a race against time. In 2017, he put out the award-winning documentary Dusk Chorus, based on his environmental sound art project Fragments of Extinction. This work combines art and data visualization through spectrograms and audio captured during his expeditions to the Amazon, Borneo and Central Africa, in an attempt to preserve the sonic footprint of incredibly biodiverse places often faced with what he calls ecocide."
64,2022-04-04,Hot carbon air,"His work demonstrates how new sounds, or a lack of them, speak volumes about the health of a habitat. In Ecuador's Yasuni National Park, for example, where there is thought to be the greatest biodiversity in the world, Mr. Monacchi captured the effects of drought (caused by climate change) and an oil plant's operations on the sonic landscape. His recordings revealed a reduction in animal vocalization, and a low swelling whirr emitted by trees in hydric distress that were also affected by xylenes (chemical compounds) from nearby oil refining."
64,2022-04-04,Hot carbon air,"In yet another approach to soundscape ecology, Mr. Bergeron often uses field recording as a kind of personal meditation, going out into the wilderness to be hyper-immersed in nature, and to experience the often-overwhelming feeling of being enveloped in magnified sound. His many recordings have grown into an archive of specific moments and places that live on as time capsules."
64,2022-04-04,Hot carbon air,"For an online music residency during the pandemic, Mr. Bergeron and three collaborators incorporated field recordings into a joint piece called Chirr, creating a soundscape that was bigger than if they'd worked together in person, combining excerpts from southeastern Quebec, Florida, Colorado and New York. The resulting piece is layered with deep rumbling synth, saxophone and the sound of rainfall, climbing to menacing crescendos alongside the voices of American robins, song sparrows and cicadas. The northeastern United States saw the insect in hordes in the spring of 2021, as the huge Brood X surfaced after being underground for 17 years."
64,2022-04-04,Hot carbon air,"As I listen to Chirr, I try to imagine how the soundscapes those cicadas emerged into were different from the previous generation's, altered by our presence. The musical project isn't meant to be a peaceful meditation though: ""These sounds are inherently overwhelming; that can be kind of an uncomfortable feeling in some challenging music. I would say that piece is kind of challenging and some people don't want to acknowledge it sometimes."
64,2022-04-04,Hot carbon air,"They want to have a pleasant listening experience, but maybe we need to be confronted a little bit with some of that ecological horror,"" Mr. Bergeron says."
64,2022-04-04,Hot carbon air,"With small creatures that can be hard to identify visually, one of the best indicators of species strength is the sounds they produce. It's why each spring I participate in an amphibian-population monitoring program run by Montreal's Zoo Ecomuseum; it consists of stopping at designated locations along a pathway to listen for croaks and note their intensity."
64,2022-04-04,Hot carbon air,"For decades, amphibians have undergone the largest death rates from a single disease in all recorded history because of a humanspread fungus called chytrid. Approximately 40 per cent of insects are also in decline worldwide, and a third are endangered."
64,2022-04-04,Hot carbon air,"As world leaders descended recently on Glasgow for the United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP26, I was reminded again about the importance of listening. With the event's net-zero emissions agreements and voluntary pledges to stop deforestation sounding eerily familiar to the 2016 Paris Agreement, skepticism about its usefulness is justified."
64,2022-04-04,Hot carbon air,"But at the very least, COP26 is a moment when the most polluting and wealthy countries are forced to listen to speakers from Tuvalu and Fiji talk about drowning because of the excesses of the Group of 20."
64,2022-04-04,Hot carbon air,"I was more interested in hearing what they and young activists such as Greta Thunberg who protested the event had to say. A sustainable future seems to feel less tenable for each new generation than the last, and these teens and children will hear more humancaused silence than my own, a void then filled with unnatural sounds."
64,2022-04-04,Hot carbon air,"Mr. Bergeron thinks about this as well. Over the summer, he worked with the \xC9cole des Arts Sutton in southeastern Quebec to show a group of kids, aged 7 to 14, the ropes of field recording during something called ""Camp de l'ennui"" (boredom camp). They were invited to hang out in a natural setting, without a plan or schedule in sight, to do whatever they wanted. Rather than set up a didactic teaching workshop to spark their interest, Mr. Bergeron decided to sit there, surrounded by greenery with his equipment set up and ready to listen."
64,2022-04-04,Hot carbon air,"He let the children who stopped by his station go off and capture whatever sounds they felt like. After, he made a video overlaid with their digital sounds that was projected during a vernissage at the end of the camp's week. The recordings are filled with giggles and excited screams, which reminded Mr. Bergeron of the play aspect to his practice.

66,2022-04-04,Scientists risk arrest to sound climate alarm,"On August 14, R. Murray Schafer, the avant-garde composer who got many to use their ears rather than their eyes, passed away at the age of 88, leaving the world a little more silent. The artist, born in Sarnia, Ont., was a pioneer of acoustic ecology (he coined the term soundscape), practising field recording to capture sounds of all kinds, and often using them in musical compositions."
66,2022-04-04,Scientists risk arrest to sound climate alarm,"His interests were as vast as the sonic worlds he committed to tape: He pioneered using graphic notation in his scores, was a visual artist, wrote books and created music theatre such as Apocalypsis, his sprawling 500-person piece from 1980 about the end times, structured in two parts: the world's destruction followed by its reconstruction. In 2015, it was restaged during the Luminato Festival with a cast of more than 1,000 people, making it the largest musical production in Toronto's history."
66,2022-04-04,Scientists risk arrest to sound climate alarm,"There are many others like Mr. Schafer. The composer influenced curious creatives who hear the wild's distress cries and fill up hard drives with recordings of ecosystems all over the world. Their aim is to create aural experiences, but also to sound the alarm through actual sounds, or the disappearance thereof. In a 2009 National Film Board short documentary called Listen by David New, Mr. Schafer says: ""In a way the world is a huge composition, a huge musical composition that's going on all the time without a beginning and presumably without an ending. We are the composers of this huge miraculous composition that's going on around us, and we can improve it or we can destroy it."""
66,2022-04-04,Scientists risk arrest to sound climate alarm,"I finally understood what Bernie Krause, another pioneer soundscape ecologist, had told me about how spaces open up when you listen through a microphone and recorder."
66,2022-04-04,Scientists risk arrest to sound climate alarm,"Though Mr. Krause started recording in the wild for musical purposes rather than preservation, his work has become a massive aural archive filled with many sounds that have otherwise disappeared entirely. He's captured more than 5,000 hours worth of habitats, and half of those no longer exist as they do in his recordings. That his ambitious work turned into an impressive auditory database, is rather a result of hindsight."
66,2022-04-04,Scientists risk arrest to sound climate alarm,"For an online music residency during the pandemic, Mr. Bergeron and three collaborators incorporated field recordings into a joint piece called Chirr, creating a soundscape that was bigger than if they'd worked together in person, combining excerpts from southeastern Quebec, Florida, Colorado and New York."
66,2022-04-04,Scientists risk arrest to sound climate alarm,"The resulting piece is layered with deep rumbling synth, saxophone and the sound of rainfall, climbing to menacing crescendos alongside the voices of American robins, song sparrows and cicadas. The northeastern United States saw the insect in hoards in the spring of 2021, as the huge Brood X surfaced after being underground for 17 years."
66,2022-04-04,Scientists risk arrest to sound climate alarm,"As I listen to Chirr, I try to imagine how the soundscapes those cicadas emerged into were different from the previous generation's, altered by our presence. The musical project isn't meant to be a peaceful meditation though: ""These sounds are inherently overwhelming, that can be kind of an uncomfortable feeling in some challenging music. I would say that piece is kind of challenging and some people don't want to acknowledge it sometimes. They want to have a pleasant listening experience, but maybe we need to be confronted a little bit with some of that ecological horror,"" Mr. Bergeron says."
66,2022-04-04,Scientists risk arrest to sound climate alarm,"Along with capturing the sonorous singularity of whole habitats, the work of soundscape ecologists and amateur field recordists alike can be used to establish aural references against which we can measure declines, to track what we are losing."
66,2022-04-04,Scientists risk arrest to sound climate alarm,"As world leaders descended recently on Glasgow for the United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP26, I was reminded again about the importance of listening. With the event's net-zero emissions agreements and voluntary pledges to stop deforestation sounding eerily familiar to the 2016 Paris Agreement, skepticism about its usefulness is justified. But at the very least, COP26 is a moment when the most polluting and wealthy countries are forced to listen to speakers from Tuvalu and Fiji talk about drowning because of the excesses of the Group of 20."
66,2022-04-04,Scientists risk arrest to sound climate alarm,"I was more interested in hearing what they and young activists such as Greta Thunberg who protested the event had to say. A sustainable future seems to feel less tenable for each new generation than the last, and these teens and children will hear more human-caused silence than my own, a void then filled with unnatural sounds. Mr. Bergeron thinks about this as well. Over the summer, he worked with the\xC9cole des Arts Sutton in southeastern Quebec to show a group of kids, aged 7 to 14, the ropes of field recording during something called ""Camp de l'ennui"" (boredom camp). They were invited to hang out in a natural setting, without a plan or schedule in sight, to do whatever they wanted. Rather than set up a didactic teaching workshop to spark their interest, Mr. Bergeron decided to sit there, surrounded by greenery with his equipment set up and ready to listen."
66,2022-04-04,Scientists risk arrest to sound climate alarm,"He let the children who stopped by his station go off and capture whatever sounds they felt like. After, he made a video overlayed with their digital sounds that was projected during a vernissage at the end of the camp's week. The recordings are filled with giggles and excited screams, which reminded Mr. Bergeron of the play aspect to his practice.

69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,Miguel González Palacios*At
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"the end of 2019, a team of researchers and conservationists recorded a sighting of a frog species thought to be extinct in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia. The Atelopus arsyecue, known as the starry night harlequin frog because of the white spots that stand out against its black skin, had not been seen for more than 30 years. The news was received with enthusiasm by the scientific community and the media, because in the midst of the mass extinction that the planet is going through, the reappearance of a species is reason for hope."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"Of the nearly 8,000 species of amphibians estimated to exist in the world, 41 percent are in danger of extinction, according to the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), an inventory that compiles information on the conservation status of different species of animals and plants. This figure makes them the most endangered vertebrates on the planet, surpassing sharks and rays (37 percent), mammals (26 percent) and birds (14 percent). Within the order of frogs, the genus harlequin or Atelopus is one of the most critical, because of the 99 species that have been described to date, 78 are threatened."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"One of the main causes of this decline is the rapid advance of chytridiomycosis, an infectious disease caused by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, known as Bd. This disease has become a pandemic that threatens the survival of amphibians and reptiles worldwide. Therefore, the reappearance of the starry night harlequin frog was, for many scientists, like a light in the darkness; an indicator that the Sierra Nevada frogs have developed some kind of resistance or adaptation to the Bd fungus that could be the key to stopping the extinction of one of the most important groups of vertebrates on the planet."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,Frogs and chytridiomycosis
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"""Atelopus are more toads than frogs,"" says Lorenzo Bautista, a farmer, naturalist guide and environmental consultant from the rural area of Minca, on the northern slopes of the Sierra Nevada, as we sip a freshly roasted coffee at La Victoria, one of Colombia's oldest coffee farms"
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"The difference between these two terms is not scientifically rigorous, but, to most people, frogs have smooth skin and toads have rough skin and more visible glands. Both, however, belong to the order Anura, a scientific name that in Greek means ""tailless""."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"Frogs of the genus Atelopus are very diverse and are characterized by their small size, between 20 and 60 centimeters, their diurnal behavior and their intense and bright colors. ""They are the jewels of our forests,"" says Lina Valencia, Andean country coordinator for Re:wild, an international organization that works for the conservation and restoration of biodiversity in more than 50 countries. Lina is also one of the promoters of the Atelopus Survival Initiative, a coalition of individuals and organizations recently formed to protect harlequin frog populations and mitigate threats to them. ""You're walking through a completely green forest and all of a sudden you see a purple, red or orange thing."""
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"Most of these frogs live around creeks, streams, swamps, lagoons and other mid- and high-elevation waterways in the tropical zone stretching from Costa Rica in the north to Bolivia in the south and French Guiana in the east."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"They reproduce through a nuptial embrace known as amplexus, a common form of mating among amphibians, which lasts from a few minutes to several days, but in the case of Atelopus can last three to four months. During all this time, the male remains cuddled on the female's back, without feeding, waiting for her to have the physiological conditions and find the right flow to lay the eggs in the creeks. In this way, the male tries to prevent other males from fertilizing them. While waiting, he can lose up to 60% of his body mass."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"Like the vast majority of amphibians, the skin of harlequin frogs is physiologically active; that is, it is actively involved in the regulation of respiration, water and electrolytes. This makes them particularly vulnerable to infection by the chytrid fungus Bd. This attaches to the skin when it comes into contact with water, which contains spores from other infected animals (see infographic), causing an abrupt change in temperature, loss of minerals, progressive suffocation, reduction of their immune defence and even death. The most visible traits of this infection are dry skin and, according to biologists, a depressed look and behavior."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"Like frogs, the Bd fungus inhabits mountainous locations with high humidity and temperate climates. However, scientists are still trying to understand why chytridiomycosis has close to 100% mortality in some populations, while in others it produces only sporadic deaths. There is also no consensus in the scientific community about its origin. It is believed that it may have originated in Africa or Asia, and that it travelled to other continents through the trafficking of species, such as the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis), and then spread on the shoes and clothes of human passers-by who had visited localities contaminated with the fungus."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"Bd was formally described in 1999 as a result of research into the drastic decline of amphibians that had been occurring around the world since the 1980s. The infection produced by this fungus has been identified as the main cause of the extinction of harlequin frog species such as Atelopus chiriquiensis, endemic to Costa Rica; the skeletal jambato (Atelopus longirostris), from Ecuador, and the Maracay yellow frog (Atelopus vogli), in Venezuela."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"The ""Samarian miracle """
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"The Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta is a true biodiversity hotspot, as it has a high degree of endemism because it is an independent mountain system, isolated from the Andes and other mountain ranges. Due to its great variation in altitude, ranging from sea level on the Caribbean coast to the snow-capped peaks of Bolívar and Colón, the highest peaks in Colombia at 5775 meters, the Sierra is home to practically all the thermal floors of the tropics, from warm dry to perpetual snow."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"Of the 41 species of harlequin frog that live in Colombia, almost half of the world's total, five are endemic to the Sierra Nevada; that is, they are found nowhere else on the planet. Of these, four have been observed and studied in the last 15 years and appear to have stable populations despite being included in the IUCN red list with some degree of threat."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"In addition to the 2019 sighting of the starry night harlequin frog, sightings of Atelopus laetissimus and Atelopus nahumae in the Minca river basin and Atelopus carrikeri in the Cebolletas páramo were reported between 2006 and 2008. These species had not been seen for more than 12 years. The fifth species inhabiting the Sierra Nevada, Atelopus walkeri, is the only one for which there are no recent reports."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"The four species that do persist have been called ""Lazarus species,"" a term recently coined in the scientific community to refer to species that are seen again after they were thought to be extinct. The name refers to the biblical account of Lazarus of Bethany, who comes back to life and rises from his deathbed after hearing the words of his nephew, Jesus of Nazareth."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"According to José Luis Pérez, a member of the Atelopus Foundation, an organization in the city of Santa Marta that works in the research and conservation of frogs and other animals in the Colombian Caribbean, the most surprising thing in the case of the Sierra Nevada is that in the same transect more than 30 specimens of harlequin frogs have been found, including one of Atelopus laetissimus, known as 'the old man', ""which has been more than 11 years since we started monitoring, it has been recaptured in all sampling, in the creek. And it has traces of Bd,"" he says."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"The continuity of this species ""is something that fills us with great joy, because finding an individual in good condition for so long tells us how the population is doing, that it has the ideal conditions in its environment to survive for so long,"" says José Luis."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"The existence of relatively stable populations and the sighting of specimens of harlequin frog species that were thought to be extinct has been a beacon for scientists fighting to stop their disappearance. According to Lina Valencia of Re:wild, the Atelopus of the Sierra Nevada could be ""the Holy Grail, the answer, the solution to the conservation of harlequin frogs, because if these species are apparently stable, there is hope for the others""."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,A night without stars?
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"The disappearance of frog populations is bad news for all living things on the planet, including humans, for several reasons. For one thing, these amphibians occupy a central position in food chains; they are predators of small animals and eat grasses, both aquatic and terrestrial, and, in turn, are prey for other larger species such as birds, reptiles and mammals. Frogs also play other very important ecological roles such as controlling pests and diseases that could affect humans, such as dengue fever and chikungunya."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"The absence of frogs can cause an imbalance in the functioning of ecosystems that triggers, like a domino effect, the extinction of other species and further loss of biodiversity. ""Everything is in the world for a reason, even if we don't understand it,"" Valencia sums it up."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"On the other hand, as Dr. Nikki Roach, amphibian and reptile conservation coordinator for the Global Species Survival Center, says, the disappearance of frogs ""is a sign that something is wrong with the environment and we need to fix it. Not only for the frogs, but for our own survival. Scientists consider the abundance of these animals to be an indicator of the health of an ecosystem and see their decline as a warning sign of possible threats to human health. It is a powerful indicator because, like all amphibians, frogs live both in water and on land -- amphibians are Greek for ""between two worlds. To that extent, their decline is a symptom of the deterioration of both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"The reproduction cycle of the starry night harlequin frog, for example, is used as a reference for the cultivation of products, such as a special type of corn that is the basis of food for young people who are in the process of training to be spiritual leaders or mamos."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"The disappearance of a species implies ""the loss of millions of years of genetic development, of biodiversity, of information that can suddenly help us find something important for us,"" as Dr. Roach affirms. This view is shared by Ruperto Chaparro Villafaña, leader of the Arhuaca community of Sogrome, on the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada, two days' drive from Valledupar. Although so far no medicinal uses have been identified for the harlequin frogs, he says, ""the genetic information that exists in the food, in the animal species, surely gives us a chance to develop more advanced medicine that will allow us to survive."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,Unraveling the mysteryThere are
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"two main hypotheses about how the Sierra Nevada harlequin frogs might be resisting the chytridiomycosis pandemic. The first suggests that the bacterial coating on their skin acts as an immune defense that inhibits the growth of the Bd fungus. This conjecture has been explored especially by Vicky Flechas, a researcher at the Humboldt Institute, through laboratory tests with samples collected from several species of frogs, including Atelopus elegans, endemic to the island of Gorgona, in the Colombian Pacific."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"This is one of the theses currently being explored by the Atelopus Foundation. If evidence is found that validates it, the bacteria could be isolated and then used in other species of harlequin frogs. In that way, it would be possible to check if these bacteria can indeed protect other frogs against the Bd fungus."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"The second hypothesis is that these Atelopus species may be resisting chytridiomycosis by means of a reproductive strategy known as the ""R strategy"". This, characteristic of small species found in unstable habitats, such as harlequin frogs, consists of laying large numbers of eggs to ensure the survival of the species. ""The populations are reproducing so fast, they are recruiting so fast, that the population is not going extinct,"" says Lina Valencia. This has happened, for example, with Atelopus cruciger, the only one of Venezuela's nine species of harlequin frog that has been reported in recent years."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"""If at least a third survive, knowing that they have a very low probability of reaching juvenile or adult size, what they do is lay a larger number of eggs to ensure the survival of at least a third,"" says José Luis Pérez."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"To these hypotheses are added others related to the specific strain of the fungus that lives in the Sierra Nevada, the geographical conditions of the Sierra that would have limited its spread, the characteristics of the ecosystem that would have inhibited its development or even others that suggest that harlequin frogs are reappearing after having overcome the most lethal peak of the pandemic."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,For
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"the indigenous communities that inhabit the Sierra Nevada, the gouna is not a lazarus species, far"
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,from it.
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"""It has never disappeared for us, not even for a year, this frog has always been there,"" says Ruperto Chaparro, who was responsible for initiating contact with the Atelopus Foundation to go to his community to record the ""reappearance"" of the starry-night harlequin frog."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"According to him, he did it moved by the desire of his community to free themselves from ""that tie that we feel for being prevented to the difference, to feel like in danger, that endurance that we have that wears us out without being able to connect with the true imagination to evolve as a society""."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"Indeed, the indigenous communities that inhabit the middle and upper parts of the Sierra Nevada have for centuries maintained a reticent attitude to the passage of outsiders, as a consequence of their conflictive interaction with the State and Colombian settlers throughout history. This may have contributed to limiting the spread of the Bd fungus, particularly through infected footwear and clothing, as well as maintaining the Sierra Nevada as one of the least explored places on the planet."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"In order to record the starry night harlequin frog in late 2019, the Atelopus Foundation team had to go through a long process of consultation with the Sogrome community, which included three years of talks alone and then four trips to the territory. The spiritual authorities of the community (the mamos) only allowed them to bring cameras to record the last trip."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"It was like a crazy thing to do, because you know that as a scientist you want the evidence,"" says José Luis Pérez. So it was like a challenge, which they (the Sogrome community) called 'resisting temptation'""."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"According to Lorenzo Bautista, another reason that has kept the Sierra Nevada as a relatively unexplored place is the lack of equipment and resources for constant biodiversity monitoring. This may have led people to think that there are species that are ""resuscitating,"" when in reality they have never disappeared. This lack of studies is not only latent in the case of amphibians, but also in the case of insects, orchids and plants in general. ""That's why now the term is 'possibly extinct', because now we don't really know,"" Pérez points out."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"However, as Dr. Nikki Roach clarifies, the above does not mean that all species believed to be extinct are simply hidden, as this depends on the particular case of each one and there are some that have not been able to be found despite having been searched for them several times."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"class=""font--secondary"">More than one threatIn addition"
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"to chytridiomycosis, harlequin frogs face two other major threats to their survival: climate change and the degradation of the ecosystems in which they live. Some experts even believe that the Bd fungus has historically been present in amphibian habitats, but that changes in environmental conditions have made them more susceptible to infection and Bd more aggressive."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"Harlequin frogs are very sensitive to large temperature variations, increased maximum and minimum temperatures, and increased UV exposure. This can lead to abrupt changes in blood temperature, uncontrolled saliva production, liver failure, salt and water imbalance in the body and, in some cases, death. Their fragility is such that all of this could happen to them just by holding them for a few minutes in a human hand."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"These amphibians are also suffering from longer summers and the El Niño phenomenon, a cyclical climate event that causes a drastic reduction in rainfall and humidity in the Sierra Nevada and much of Colombia. With global warming accelerating, El Niño is becoming more frequent, longer and more intense. For the frogs, surviving four or more months of zero humidity and skin lacerations from the sun's rays is an increasing challenge."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"Added to this is the direct impact of human activities such as cattle ranching and coffee production that cause, among other things, deforestation, loss of habitat and breeding grounds, water pollution and increased soil acidity."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"And while all this does not affect only frogs, for them it represents a greater danger for a simple reason: due to their small size, their mobility is reduced and they have home ranges that do not exceed, on average, 200 meters. Because of this, ""they cannot walk or move to adapt to climate change, so they have to adapt or they will die. Birds, mammals, can fly or walk, but species that are smaller don't have that option,"" says Roach."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,Shining into the futureWhile
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"collecting and analyzing samples of the bacterial layer to eventually develop a ""cure"" for chytridiomycosis, the Atelopus Foundation is also working to describe a new species endemic to the Sierra Nevada. According to the Atelopus Survival Initiative, an estimated 29 species in addition to the 99 that have been recorded to date have yet to be described."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"This is a paradox of many species from little explored places. While some scientists believe that their situation is much more critical than they think, others not only ""rediscover"" species, such as the starry-night harlequin frog, but also find new species of the same genus. Atelopus frontierus, a small frog with a yellow and black striped pattern, was recently discovered in the jungles of the Darien, on the border between Panama and Colombia, for example."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"But beyond research, the survival of the harlequin frogs depends on concrete and urgent conservation actions, such as reforestation and watershed conservation, as well as the collection of garbage and contaminants that could affect them. For this, the participation of local communities is indispensable. That is why another of the work fronts of the Atelopus Foundation is the empowerment of the farmers of different localities of the Sierra Nevada, ""so that the community is filled with pride, to take ownership of what they have, because if not, they do not give importance to these species and they are the ones who are called to take care of their biodiversity,"" says Sintana Rojas, José Luis Pérez's partner."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"""Man must adapt, not only for himself, but for the species that, like frogs, cannot adapt,"" Lorenzo Bautista tells me as we drink a last cup of coffee after returning from our unsuccessful expedition in search of harlequin frogs. ""They are species without resistance,"" he concludes."
69,2022-04-11,Scientists Hit the Streets,"The future of the frogs and many other species, including our own, depends on us. For that, we need collaboration and coordinated work between local and regional actors in different parts of the world in order to save not only Atelopus and amphibians, but thousands of species of different orders and genera around the world. As Lina Valencia says, ""a constellation shines brighter than a star""."

74,2022-04-05,Mass coral bleaching of Australia's Great Barrier Reef goes under the media radar, Hockensmith explained that another contributing factor to the frog's decline is pesticides. Frogs breathe through their skin so the introduction of pesticides causes a chemical imbalance.
74,2022-04-05,Mass coral bleaching of Australia's Great Barrier Reef goes under the media radar," The frog's habitats are also threatened by grazing livestock, which has been an ongoing debate in the Sierra Nevada."
74,2022-04-05,Mass coral bleaching of Australia's Great Barrier Reef goes under the media radar," Researchers found dead frogs not being consumed by predators, which led to the discovery of amphibian chytrid fungus. Amphibian chytrid fungus attaches to the keratin of frogs and tadpoles, restricting their ability to absorb water and breathe."
74,2022-04-05,Mass coral bleaching of Australia's Great Barrier Reef goes under the media radar, This fungus has spread across the Sierra for the last 40-50 years and has wiped out many amphibians.
74,2022-04-05,Mass coral bleaching of Australia's Great Barrier Reef goes under the media radar," Ample funding, time and scientific attention is required to be listed as an endangered species."
74,2022-04-05,Mass coral bleaching of Australia's Great Barrier Reef goes under the media radar, In 2012 the California Fish and Game Commission added the mountain yellow-legged frog to its list of animals protected as endangered species and in 2014 they were added to the federal endangered species list.
74,2022-04-05,Mass coral bleaching of Australia's Great Barrier Reef goes under the media radar," The yellow-legged frog could be extinct within decades, according to Center for Biological Diversity scientists."
74,2022-04-05,Mass coral bleaching of Australia's Great Barrier Reef goes under the media radar," Research biologist at the University of California Sierra Nevada Aquatic Laboratory, Roland Knapp, has dedicated over 20 years researching the frogs and believes population recovery is still possible."
74,2022-04-05,Mass coral bleaching of Australia's Great Barrier Reef goes under the media radar, Knapp explained that a fishless habitat along with increased resistance to chytrid fungus can allow populations to rebound and increase.
74,2022-04-05,Mass coral bleaching of Australia's Great Barrier Reef goes under the media radar, Knapp's research has shown the frogs being able to adapt to the disease over time.
74,2022-04-05,Mass coral bleaching of Australia's Great Barrier Reef goes under the media radar," ""The last 10-15 years have been truly remarkable with frog populations,"" Knapp said. ""I have a lot of hope. I wouldn't have said that 10 years ago."""
74,2022-04-05,Mass coral bleaching of Australia's Great Barrier Reef goes under the media radar, Knapp has said he had been watching the decline since the mid 1990s when the frog population was critically low. He explained that these frogs have evolved millions of years as a top predator and taking out a top predator can have devastating effects on an ecosystem similar to the wolves' impact in Yellowstone National Park.
74,2022-04-05,Mass coral bleaching of Australia's Great Barrier Reef goes under the media radar," Wolves were eradicated or driven from Yellowstone in the 1920s and in the decades that followed the park's ecosystem fell out of balance with exploding elk and coyote populations that in turn effected plant life, bird species and riparian habitat."
74,2022-04-05,Mass coral bleaching of Australia's Great Barrier Reef goes under the media radar," Recognizing a changing ecosystem is difficult when the ecosystem is not terrestrial. Knapp explained that if you were to stick your head underwater, you can see directly how different the ecosystem is between lakes with and without fish."
74,2022-04-05,Mass coral bleaching of Australia's Great Barrier Reef goes under the media radar, He said a balance needs to be found to make sure the frogs are protected by halting the stocking of fish or removing fish from selective lakes that are critical for their habitat. He hopes to collectively agree to set a few lakes aside as habitat for native species. The goal is for the frogs to recover while having minimal effect on recreation.
74,2022-04-05,Mass coral bleaching of Australia's Great Barrier Reef goes under the media radar," ""Every lake in the Sierra is someone's favorite fishing lake,"" he said."
74,2022-04-05,Mass coral bleaching of Australia's Great Barrier Reef goes under the media radar," Knapp says progress is being made, ""They are moving slowly but surely away from extinction."""
74,2022-04-05,Mass coral bleaching of Australia's Great Barrier Reef goes under the media radar, Actively adding the frogs back into fishless lakes is another important component.
74,2022-04-05,Mass coral bleaching of Australia's Great Barrier Reef goes under the media radar, The U.S. Forest Service Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit has also spent time and effort surveying the fish and frogs in efforts to balance the ecosystem.
74,2022-04-05,Mass coral bleaching of Australia's Great Barrier Reef goes under the media radar, CDFW staff has removed some fish from lakes that provide minimal recreation value.
74,2022-04-05,Mass coral bleaching of Australia's Great Barrier Reef goes under the media radar," ""If people don't understand what's going on, there will be no change,"" Hockensmith said."
74,2022-04-05,Mass coral bleaching of Australia's Great Barrier Reef goes under the media radar," ""There could be a chain reaction that we might not quite fully understand,"" she continued. ""There will be an impact whether people completely understand or not."""

79,2022-04-06,How Climatologists Forgot the Sun Was Shining: Your Questions Answered,Concerns are being raised at a Portland Town Council meeting this evening over proposals that would remove protected status for all of Portland's widespread amphibian and reptile species.
79,2022-04-06,How Climatologists Forgot the Sun Was Shining: Your Questions Answered,It also means that the presence of currently protected reptile species on Portland would no longer be grounds for contesting planning applications by developers.

79,2022-04-06,How Climatologists Forgot the Sun Was Shining: Your Questions Answered,"I am writing to express my concern about important changes to the status of many of our widespread species in the United Kingdom as a result of the 7th Quinquennial Review (QQR) of Schedules 5 and 8 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981) (WCA) which is being coordinated by the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC). This review will provide recommendations to the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and to Ministers for the Environment in the Scottish Government and Welsh Government for changes to these schedules."
79,2022-04-06,How Climatologists Forgot the Sun Was Shining: Your Questions Answered,"I understand that the 2021 review seeks to change the 'Eligibility Criteria' of species currently (and in future times) listed under Schedules 5 and 8, such that the country-based nature conservation bodies will only pursue scheduling of a species when an animal or plant is in danger of extinction in Great Britain."
79,2022-04-06,How Climatologists Forgot the Sun Was Shining: Your Questions Answered,"This shift in focus will preferentially consider GB Red Listed species, i.e. those facing imminent threat of extinction (IUCN 2012) in GB Schedules 5 and 8 of the WCA. However, a great swathe of other widespread species where there is either no evidence of a massive decline, or it has not been assessed against the IUCN national or regional Red List Criteria will not be considered."
79,2022-04-06,How Climatologists Forgot the Sun Was Shining: Your Questions Answered,"This will effectively remove any form of protection from many of our well-loved widespread species. This could include red squirrels and water voles as well as common frog, common toad and the small newts; and reptiles such as the slow-worm, grass snake, adder and viviparous lizard."
79,2022-04-06,How Climatologists Forgot the Sun Was Shining: Your Questions Answered,I believe this could have the following specific impacts on our amphibians and reptiles:

80,2022-04-05,Cool Effect Celebrates the Good on the Ground and Positive Impact of Carbon-Reducing Projects,A fungus reportedly found on all continents where amphibians live is also impacting frogs and salamanders on the Tongass and Chugach National Forests.
80,2022-04-05,Cool Effect Celebrates the Good on the Ground and Positive Impact of Carbon-Reducing Projects,"The amphibian chytrid fungus, or Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is thought to be originally from Asia. While some frog species (e.g., bullfrogs) appear resistant to the disease, Bd has caused the decline of more than 500 species of amphibians worldwide, including 90 possible extinctions."
80,2022-04-05,Cool Effect Celebrates the Good on the Ground and Positive Impact of Carbon-Reducing Projects," Knowing the potential virulence of Bd, Tongass biologists plan to sample for it this field season to further refine the distribution of the fungus across the forest. This follows a study last year by the Tongass Wildlife and Fisheries program where eDNA was used to survey the presence of Bd in waterbodies at several locations across the forest. The pathogen was found at multiple sites on Prince of Wales Island, Wrangell Island, and at one of 10 sites in the Yakutat area."
80,2022-04-05,Cool Effect Celebrates the Good on the Ground and Positive Impact of Carbon-Reducing Projects," While describing its distribution is an important step in managing the disease, regional biologists recognize that this alone is insufficient to protect Alaska's native amphibians. To better manage it and other amphibian diseases, the Forest Service Alaska Region is working with its forests and interagency partners to spearhead the development of an amphibian disease working group."
80,2022-04-05,Cool Effect Celebrates the Good on the Ground and Positive Impact of Carbon-Reducing Projects," The group's focus will be to develop strategies and protocols to understand and address the factors facilitating the spread of amphibian pathogens, to limit further spread of the pathogens, and to minimize the impact of these diseases on Alaska's frogs and salamanders."
80,2022-04-05,Cool Effect Celebrates the Good on the Ground and Positive Impact of Carbon-Reducing Projects," Bd was discovered in Alaska in 2000. Subsequently, a team of researchers led by Michael Adams and Black Hossack from the U.S. Geological Survey sampled frogs across the Tongass to determine the prevalence of Bd in the frogs."
80,2022-04-05,Cool Effect Celebrates the Good on the Ground and Positive Impact of Carbon-Reducing Projects," They found Bd-infected western toads at multiple locations in the Haines and Skagway areas, as well as three sites on Prince of Wales Island. It was not found on Admiralty Island or Douglas Island. Carmen Harjoe, during her Ph.D. research conducted from 2015 to 2018, detected Bd at 11 of 13 sites on the Chugach's Cordova District."
80,2022-04-05,Cool Effect Celebrates the Good on the Ground and Positive Impact of Carbon-Reducing Projects," Alaska's two national forests host three salamander and three frog species that are native to the Tongass, with two frog species extending their range into the Chugach. An additional two frog species have been accidentally introduced to the Tongass as well. These native amphibians are vital components of the forests, consuming a suite of invertebrates and being prey for many fish, birds, and small carnivores. The frog is also an important cultural symbol for some Alaska Native peoples, depicted in their art and stories."

81,2022-04-05,The climate costs of pay now/pay later spelled out,"The survey was created in 1981 by DNR scientists Ruth Hine and Mike Mossman in response to concerns over declining frog populations in Wisconsin, primarily northern leopard frogs, Blanchard's cricket frogs, pickerel frogs and American bullfrogs."
81,2022-04-05,The climate costs of pay now/pay later spelled out,"The Wisconsin work started against a backdrop of dwindling global populations of amphibians due to habitat fragmentation, wetland loss and emerging diseases including the chytrid fungus."
81,2022-04-05,The climate costs of pay now/pay later spelled out,"Mossman was involved with amphibian research at the time and Hine, a wildlife ecologist, had just finished editing Dick Vogt's book, ""Natural History of Amphibians and Reptiles of Wisconsin."" Hine decided to create a roadside survey to monitor frogs, similar to the highly successful federal Breeding Bird Survey."
81,2022-04-05,The climate costs of pay now/pay later spelled out,"Since then, thousands of people have been involved in the survey, and their information has helped conservation biologists determine the status, distribution and long-term population trends of Wisconsin's frogs and toads."
81,2022-04-05,The climate costs of pay now/pay later spelled out,The DNR shares the data in annual reports and uses the information to steer management actions.
81,2022-04-05,The climate costs of pay now/pay later spelled out,"The data paint a mixed picture in Wisconsin. The survey has detected long-term increases in spring peepers, gray treefrogs and American bullfrogs and declines in populations of northern leopard frogs, pickerel frogs, mink frogs and American toads, according to the DNR."
81,2022-04-05,The climate costs of pay now/pay later spelled out,"But there is reason for optimism. Recent work suggests the Blanchard's cricket frog is increasing in areas near the Mississippi River and is stable in southern Wisconsin, including in the Mukwonago River watershed, Badje said."
81,2022-04-05,The climate costs of pay now/pay later spelled out,"And the chytrid fungus, which causes sloughing of skin, lethargy, weight loss, and potentially death in frogs and toads, hasn't been linked with population level declines in Wisconsin amphibians."

81,2022-04-05,The climate costs of pay now/pay later spelled out,Another piece of good news: Wisconsinites enthusiastically responded to a call for volunteers for this year's frog and toad survey.
81,2022-04-05,The climate costs of pay now/pay later spelled out,"For the first time since it started in 1981, all routes statewide are taken, Badje said."

84,2022-04-04,Connecticut must better educate its students on climate change,"The changes, which have not been widely heralded by the government, could benefit property developers and infrastructure projects such as road-building, which currently have to take account of rare species found within the proposed development areas, and sometimes have to be changed or moved as a result."
84,2022-04-04,Connecticut must better educate its students on climate change,"Angela Julian, coordinator of Amphibian and Reptile Groups of the UK (ARG UK), which represents 37 local groups and over 4,000 members, said: ""We are shocked to discover these proposed changes, which will effectively remove any form of protection from many of our well-loved widespread species including slow worms, grass snakes and viviparous lizards. Our native wildlife deserves a fair hearing."""
84,2022-04-04,Connecticut must better educate its students on climate change,"Under the Wildlife and Countryside Act (WCA) of 1981, the government must review the status of protected species on a five-yearly basis, a process now under way. The WCA classifies the UK's rare flora and fauna, with legal protections for those considered at risk."
84,2022-04-04,Connecticut must better educate its students on climate change,"When species are protected, it becomes illegal to harm them, for instance through hunting or plant-collecting, or to sell or trade in them. Protections can also extend to their habitat, which can affect infrastructure and development schemes such as housebuilding or new roads."

84,2022-04-04,Connecticut must better educate its students on climate change,"The IUCN draws up the global Red List by which species are classified in nine categories including vulnerable, endangered and critically endangered. However, the letter warns that the government's proposals would mean dropping current safeguards for all species except those at the worst end of the scale, regarded as at imminent risk of extinction. That would leave in the lurch species which may still be under severe threat but whose populations have improved slightly, often owing to conservation efforts."
84,2022-04-04,Connecticut must better educate its students on climate change,"""The changes [also] remove the opportunity to prevent species decline,"" the organisations say. ""Under the changes outlined, we will only be reacting to catastrophic species declines."""
84,2022-04-04,Connecticut must better educate its students on climate change,"Richard Benwell, the chief executive of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said the species that would certainly have protection removed under the changes included stag beetles, purple emperor butterflies, pine martens, brown hares and mountain hares. Species that were likely to have protection removed included adders, smooth newts, grass snakes and basking sharks."
84,2022-04-04,Connecticut must better educate its students on climate change,"Amphibians could also be at particular risk, because if it becomes legal to trade in certain species, wild samples could be bought and sold and mixed with captive collections around the country.

85,2022-04-05,"Op-Ed: Climate - Nothing is being achieved, last decade to turn things around","If you have a lighter soil your bog will be more of a dish shape and may require a bit more room, but this can actually be a positive because the frogs can access the water from all sides. Collect any clay that you can from the hole and put it in a bucket or barrow with enough water to moisten it. Many of you may not have a lot of clay in your soil, but don't worry, you just need to get your hands on some bentonite clay from either agricultural or pottery suppliers."
85,2022-04-05,"Op-Ed: Climate - Nothing is being achieved, last decade to turn things around","Bentonite is a type of clay that, when wet, will swell up to about 10 times its original size, so it will form an impermeable seal."

Dr. Deb Miller and Dr. Matt Gray lead the Amphibian Disease Laboratory at the University of Tennessee and are looking at various strategies to prevent a fungus that is deadly to salamanders from entering the U.S. via the international pet trade. They are also conducting research to learn more about the disease, and looking at potential strategies to reduce the spread of the fungus in case it does enter the country."
87,2022-04-08,Nationalize the U.S. Fossil Fuel Industry to Save the Planet,Deb Miller and Matt Gray talk about the Bsal fungus and their efforts to protect salamanders.
87,2022-04-08,Nationalize the U.S. Fossil Fuel Industry to Save the Planet, Why do the Appalachian mountains have so many salamanders?
87,2022-04-08,Nationalize the U.S. Fossil Fuel Industry to Save the Planet," The intersection of North Carolina, Tennessee and Georgia is a global biodiversity hot spot for salamanders. Tennessee, for example, has around 60 species, more than the entire continent of Europe."
87,2022-04-08,Nationalize the U.S. Fossil Fuel Industry to Save the Planet," The southern Appalachian Mountain Range is one of the oldest mountain ranges in the world, so there has been a lot of opportunity for many species to evolve over a long period of time. The temperate conditions and high elevations create a forest system with lots of moisture and accumulated leaf litter. Over time, that creates the perfect habitat for salamanders."
87,2022-04-08,Nationalize the U.S. Fossil Fuel Industry to Save the Planet, What is the fungus that threatens the salamanders?
87,2022-04-08,Nationalize the U.S. Fossil Fuel Industry to Save the Planet," Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, or Bsal, is the second chytrid fungus that has been discovered. The first chytrid fungus that many people have heard about is called Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, or Bd, and that's been associated with the decline of over 500 amphibian species globally and over 100 species extinctions."
87,2022-04-08,Nationalize the U.S. Fossil Fuel Industry to Save the Planet," Bsal fungus specifically attacks the outer covering of a salamander's skin, but we are finding that it can attack frog skin as well. The skin is one of the most important organs in an amphibian's body. It is so important because some salamanders don't have lungs, and so the skin is a major source for respiration for them. It also maintains the right amount of hydration so that their body systems, including their heart, can function properly."
87,2022-04-08,Nationalize the U.S. Fossil Fuel Industry to Save the Planet," The name salamandrivorans literally means that it eats the salamander. In actuality, it destroys the skin with a coating of fungus. The skin stops functioning, and the animal shuts down and dies."
87,2022-04-08,Nationalize the U.S. Fossil Fuel Industry to Save the Planet," The fungus hasn't yet entered North America, but what was its effect on amphibians in Europe?"
87,2022-04-08,Nationalize the U.S. Fossil Fuel Industry to Save the Planet," The discovery of a new chytrid fungus in Northern Europe was very alarming. It was discovered in 2010, and since then, salamander populations all over Europe have seen precipitous declines. There's now research that indicates that it may have actually been introduced around Germany and spread out from there."
87,2022-04-08,Nationalize the U.S. Fossil Fuel Industry to Save the Planet," It has been found in Southeast Asia infecting salamanders but having no effects on them. It seems to live with the salamanders there. But it is believed to have been introduced to Europe through the international pet trade. We have not detected Bsal yet here in North America, or any place in the Western Hemisphere, but we are concerned that the pet trade is the most likely route for introduction here."
87,2022-04-08,Nationalize the U.S. Fossil Fuel Industry to Save the Planet, What are the steps being taken to prevent it from entering the US?
87,2022-04-08,Nationalize the U.S. Fossil Fuel Industry to Save the Planet," The United States has been fairly proactive in its response to Bsal. The US Fish and Wildlife Service passed a moratorium in 2016 on the importation of around 200 species of salamanders that could serve as possible hosts to Bsal. That effectively stopped most of the salamander trade coming into our country. However, since then, we've learned that frogs can become infected with Bsal too, which constitute 95% of trade, so the threat of introduction to the U.S. remains."
87,2022-04-08,Nationalize the U.S. Fossil Fuel Industry to Save the Planet," There has been very limited surveillance for Bsal out in the pet industry, and we're working on partnerships that would expand sampling for Bsal. It's also in the industry's interest because it threatens the captive populations and their profits."
87,2022-04-08,Nationalize the U.S. Fossil Fuel Industry to Save the Planet, What is your research focusing on?
87,2022-04-08,Nationalize the U.S. Fossil Fuel Industry to Save the Planet," With regard to pathology, we're looking at a few different things. One, what does it do to the body other than taking away the skin? What is the critical point at which we might be able to do something? And are there bacteria or other opportunistic pathogens playing a role in the sickness?"
87,2022-04-08,Nationalize the U.S. Fossil Fuel Industry to Save the Planet," In terms of research on transmission and disease intervention strategies, we've been looking at what happens if it gets into a pond system here. Could we go into that pond system and reduce the density of the salamanders, just as humans are doing with social distancing during the pandemic?"
87,2022-04-08,Nationalize the U.S. Fossil Fuel Industry to Save the Planet," Bsal spreads through water, but also direct contact, and so we reduce that ability for either the pathogen to swim or for salamanders to bump into each other by increasing the number of plants around their habitat, and hence the habitat complexity."
87,2022-04-08,Nationalize the U.S. Fossil Fuel Industry to Save the Planet," We also are looking at plant-derived fungicides. Salamander skin has lots of natural microbes on it, and we're trying to supplement their natural microbiome on their skin to help in the defense of this pathogen."
87,2022-04-08,Nationalize the U.S. Fossil Fuel Industry to Save the Planet, So we collaborate with colleagues from several universities to investigate all of those questions.
87,2022-04-08,Nationalize the U.S. Fossil Fuel Industry to Save the Planet, What role do salamanders play in this ecosystem?
87,2022-04-08,Nationalize the U.S. Fossil Fuel Industry to Save the Planet," It's been estimated that in a typical pond system, amphibians can consume over a million insects in a year, including mosquitoes. They consume adults as well as larvae before they can bite you or transmit a zoonotic disease. Both tadpoles and salamander larvae love to eat the little mosquito larvae, which are very nutritious. They play a similar role to that of bats in the air."

95,2022-04-09,Twistin' with Gallup's Extreme Weather Poll,BY ANN CAMERON S IEGAL Special To The Washington Post
95,2022-04-09,Twistin' with Gallup's Extreme Weather Poll,"To some, they're cute personalities in kids' movies and books. To others they look slimy and warty. But by taking time to observe, you'll find that frogs and toads are amazing amphibians."
95,2022-04-09,Twistin' with Gallup's Extreme Weather Poll,"All toads are frogs, but not all frogs are toads, say naturalists. Nature can be complicated, so let's dig deeper."
95,2022-04-09,Twistin' with Gallup's Extreme Weather Poll,"Scientists don't make a distinction between frogs and toads. They all belong to the largest amphibian order called Anura, meaning the adults are ""without a tail."""
95,2022-04-09,Twistin' with Gallup's Extreme Weather Poll,"Frogs are an important part of our ecosystem, said Brooks Paternotte, director of the Irvine Nature Center in Owings Mills, Maryland. ""They're the 'canary in the coal mine.'"" That expression refers to a now-abandoned practice of taking caged canaries into mines. The birds would react quickly to poisonous gases, alerting miners to the danger."
95,2022-04-09,Twistin' with Gallup's Extreme Weather Poll,"Like those canaries, frogs let us know when our environment needs help."
95,2022-04-09,Twistin' with Gallup's Extreme Weather Poll,"Frogs thrive with plenty of insects to eat and an abundance of healthy ponds, marshes or other wetlands to lay their eggs. ""If you don't hear frogs around their normal habitats on spring evenings, that's a signal that something is wrong in the area,"" Paternotte said."
95,2022-04-09,Twistin' with Gallup's Extreme Weather Poll,"There are more than 7,000 species of frogs in the world, about 100 of which are in the United States. Found everywhere except Antarctica, frogs are grouped into three basic categories. True frogs have moist skin as they must live in or near water. Tree frogs have sticky pads on their feet for climbing. True toads have dry bumpy skin, are more drought tolerant and live mostly on land, but need access to healthy water for egg-laying."
95,2022-04-09,Twistin' with Gallup's Extreme Weather Poll,"Frogs seem like champion jumpers, reaching more than 10 times their length in distance. Imagine if you could jump 10 times your height from a standing position. A kid who is four feet tall could jump more than the length of a school bus!"
95,2022-04-09,Twistin' with Gallup's Extreme Weather Poll,"Scan wetlands looking for frog eggs and tadpoles. Frog eggs are in clusters, while toad eggs form long narrow strands."
95,2022-04-09,Twistin' with Gallup's Extreme Weather Poll,"Frogs need gentle slopes to the water so they can get in and out easily. Toads are often found in backyard gardens, on a forest floor, or camouflaged in leaves and tree stumps."
95,2022-04-09,Twistin' with Gallup's Extreme Weather Poll,"It's mating season now for many frogs, so you can hear the males calling in the evening."
95,2022-04-09,Twistin' with Gallup's Extreme Weather Poll,"""Toads may even be on your steps, looking for moths under outdoor lights,"" Hasenstab said. Regardless of where you look for frogs, Paternotte said, ""close your beak and open your eyes and ears. Stealth is key. The more quietly and thoughtfully you move, the more you will see."""
95,2022-04-09,Twistin' with Gallup's Extreme Weather Poll,"Find a good frog habitat at a park or nature center, and play a game: How long can you sit without moving and making a sound? You might be surprised at the types of frogs you'll see."

95,2022-04-09,Twistin' with Gallup's Extreme Weather Poll,"You don't get warts if you handle a toad. ""The worst thing that will happen to you,"" said Jeron Winters, a naturalist at Arlington's Long Branch Nature Center, ""is it will pee on you."""
95,2022-04-09,Twistin' with Gallup's Extreme Weather Poll,"He cautioned, ""Don't pick up amphibians. They breathe through their skin."" They can be harmed by sprays, lotions or food residue on your hands."
95,2022-04-09,Twistin' with Gallup's Extreme Weather Poll,"Some frogs and all toads excrete toxins that can harm predators, said National Zoo biologist Sara Hasenstab. ""If your dog puts a toad in its mouth, the awful taste and irritation will hopefully teach the dog to leave toads alone,"" she said."

95,2022-04-09,Twistin' with Gallup's Extreme Weather Poll,"Think carefully about getting one as a pet. Never take wild amphibians as pets. Pet shop frogs may be nonnative species and may spread chytrid fungus (pronounced KYtrud), which has destroyed more than 500 amphibian species worldwide since the late 1990s. Never release a pet frog or toad into the wild. Enjoy watching frogs in their natural habitats or garden ponds."

96,2022-04-05,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #498,"The critically endangered variable harlequin toad, Atelopus varius, lives deep in the central American rainforests of Panama and Costa Rica, breeding only in turbulent streams filled with stones and boulders on which they lay their eggs."
96,2022-04-05,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #498,"Scientists at the University of Manchester went to Santa Fe national park in Panama and recorded the conditions of the amphibians' native habitat. They used the data to re-create the temperatures, water levels and water flow in captivity. Special lighting meant that a certain tropical alga, which the tadpoles feed on using specialised sucker-like mouthparts, could thrive."
96,2022-04-05,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #498,"The breeding programme is the result of three years of work, after six of the vibrant yellow and black toads were brought from Panama in 2018. If the species goes extinct in its native habitat, tadpoles could be bred in captivity and reintroduced, said Andrew Gray, curator of herpetology at the museum."
96,2022-04-05,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #498,"""The university is the only institution outside Panama to house these frogs. It's a huge responsibility the team do not take lightly,"" he said. ""So we're over the moon we've achieved the first captive breeding of this remarkable species [outside Panama]. Our success heralds the next chapter for more innovative amphibian conservation work."
96,2022-04-05,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #498,"""We were very nervous about putting them in such deep water but they walked along the bottom just like they were walking on land. It was unbelievable,"" he said. ""The adults can stay underwater for very long periods before breeding and were in the aquarium for over a month."""
96,2022-04-05,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #498,"Gray's team is also raising funds to support the toads in their natural habitat, which he says is their priority, and has been training local people how to monitor them. According to the IUCN the toads are critically endangered, with climate change, habitat destruction, hunting and invasive species among the main threats."
96,2022-04-05,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #498,"The toad, sometimes known as the ""clown frog"", was once widely distributed. Populations plummeted as a result of the rise of the international pet trade in the 1990s, but the spread of the deadly chytrid fungus is now considered their main threat. They were thought to have gone extinct in Costa Rica because of the spread of the fungus but a small population was rediscovered in a mountainous reserve in 2013."
96,2022-04-05,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #498,"Dr Luis Urena, the director of Panama Wildlife Conservation charity , which collaborated on the project, said looking after biodiversity must be a top global priority. ""We are proud to use the conservation of the harlequin toad of Panama as an example of the positive difference we can make,"" he said."
96,2022-04-05,Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #498, This article was corrected on 8 and 16 March 2021. The original picture was not of the species referred to in the article; and the text was amended to clarify that it is the first in-captivity breeding done outside Panama.
